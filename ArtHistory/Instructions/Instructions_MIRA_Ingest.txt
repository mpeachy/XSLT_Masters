Process for ingesting Art History images and associated metadata into MIRA for display in Trove

First, Art and Art History students and catalogers occasionally change the field names in the Excel sheet.  A copy of the existing field names is available in the 'Instructions' folder.  Copy and paste them into the first row of the Excel sheet you are working with.  This will ensure that the ART_RunThisFor_DublinCore xslt transforms all content.

After you have updated the field names, move your Excel file(s) to the appropriate folder(Transforms/create_DublinCore/excel), and work through the next steps:

1.	From oXygen, select File/Import/Ms Excel Files:

2.	Navigate to the Excel file that needs to be imported.  Make sure it is an Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls)

3.	Open it, and select:
                a.	Next -->

4.	In Import criteria select: 
		a.	First row contains field names
		b.	Open in Editor

5.	Check to make sure the import seems successful, and remove any blank rows by running the following find and replace:
		a. Select regular selection
		b. De-select dot matches all.
		c. In ‘Find:’write:<row>(\W.*<.*\w><\/.*\w>\W.*)+<\/row>
		d. In ‘Replace with:’ leave blank
		e. Find and replace all (reformat the xml for readability if necessary) and then save this file by each cataloger's first name, i.e. 'Alex.xml' in Transforms/create_DublinCore/xml

6. 	Open “collection.xml” and enter the names of each cataloger that contributed to the batch being transformed, i.e., if both Lydia and Alex contributed to the group of items that need to be transformed:

                       <doc href="Lydia.xml"/>
                       <doc href=“Alex.xml"/>

Conversely, if only Lydia contributed to a set, then you would only use Lydia’s name in the collection.xml.
			<doc href="Lydia.xml"/>

7.	From Transforms/create_DublinCore open ART_RunThisFor_DublinCore.xsl

8.      Associate your input xml (collection.xml) and save your new file via the Wrench button.
                a. Select your xslt (if there is no xslt, you will make a new one, and then follow from b), and select edit.
                b. From xslt tab, browse (folder) to collection.xml
                c. From output tab, browse (folder) to where you want to save your new xml as ingestThis.xml

9.	Select Apply transformation scenario via the Play button.

10.     In your new xml, clean up issues by limiting a regex to an xpath, for instance, look for use of possessives in a title
                a. Select Find/Replace:
                        i. Select Regular expression and in Text to find:
                        ii. '\w
                        iii. In the xpath field enter: /input/digitalObject/*[namespace-uri()='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/' and local-name()='title'] | /input/digitalObject/*[namespace-uri()='http://purl.org/dc/terms/' and local-name()='alternative']
                             This limits your search to the title and alternative title fields
                        iv. Make changes to any possessive that seems off
11.	Review xml for other pre-prossing errors, and then save it in the folder in Trove in which the images that need to be ingested are stored.

12.	From MIRA start a Batch XML ingest.
		a.	Select your ingestThis.xml in the folder that has the images, and then select Next
		b.	Associate requested images
		c.	Review batch status
