        <Description>Description: This scene from the Tale of Genji handscrolls depicts Chapter 50, entitled 'Azumaya' ('The Eastern Cottage'). The illustration places the spectator above a room without a roof, known as fukinuki yatai (or 'blown off roof' technique). The Tale of Genji scroll was unrolled a section at a time and read from right to left, similar to a Chinese handscroll. The action in this scene therefore begins in the right-hand corner, where we see ladies-in-waiting sitting behind a hanging screen. Further over to the left, Lady Naka no Kimi is having her long hair combed by an attendant. Naka no Kimi's sister, Ukifune, sits opposite to her and examines a picture scroll, while her lady-in-waiting reads the corresponding text. At first glance, this scene seems like a straightforward presentation of the lives and activities of courtly women. However, the left sliding screen appears to be slightly open. In the story, Prince Niou has taken advantage of the open screen to spy on Ukifune. Although Niou is not visible in the illustration, his invasive presence is marked by the open screen. | Location created: Japan | Date created: Late Heian period, c. 12th century CE | Current location: Tokugawa Art Museum, Nagoya | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on paper | Measurements: height 8 1/2 in (21.6 cm)

        <Description>Description: Illustrated scenes such as this from The Tale of Genji handscrolls are considered to be the most outstanding among the earliest yamato-e. Yamato-e is considered the classical Japanese style. In this scene depicting Kashiwagi, we see such features as a high density of composition, people drawn with simple "hooks" for noses (kagibana) and elongated "lines" for eyes (hikime), as well as depictions of the interiors of buildings shown from a top view with the roof removed (fukinuki yatai).  | Location created: Japan | Date created: Late Heian period, c. 12th century CE | Current location: Tokugawa Art Museum, Nagoya | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on paper | Measurements: height 8 1/2 in (21.6 cm)

        <Description>Description: Shigisan-engi is an emakimono (handscroll) that illustrates the stories and miracles attributed to the Shingon monk Myoren, who lived on Mount Shigi near Nara in the latter half of the 9th century CE. The tales are composed in the genre of 'engi,' a narrative that chronicles Buddhist temple origins. The tales are painted in a style called otoko-e, or "men's pictures", a style characterized by active movement, outdoor scenes and a certain feeling of lacking restraint. As a work that draws from classical Japanese culture, it is also referred to as yamato-e. | Location created: Japan | Date created: Early 12th century CE | Current location: Chogosonshi-ji, Nara | Medium:  Scroll painting, ink &amp; colors on paper | Measurements: 74.7 x 35.5 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: This is a detail from the emakimono (handscroll), Minister Kibi's Trip to China. Humorous and poignant, its subject is the fictional adventures of Kibi no Makibi, an ambassador sent from Nara to Tang China between 752 and 753.  The paintings depict Kibi's outwitting of the wily Chinese with the help of Abe no Nakamaro (698-770), an emissary who was never able to return to Japan and so was thought to have become an angry spirit. It is not impossible that the production of the Kibi scrolls was in part meant to pacify Kibi no Makibi’s angry spirit. In this detail, we see Kibi and Abe peek at the lecture.   | Location created: Japan | Date created: 12th century CE   | Current location: Boston Museum of Fine Arts | Medium: Handscroll, ink and color on paper  | Measurements: Height 32.2 cm</Description>

        <Contributors></Contributors>
        <Description>Description: The Chōjū-giga scrolls (also referred to as Scrolls of Frolicking Animals) are often attributed to Kakuyū (also known as Toba Sōjō); however, it seems probable from the style that more than one artist is involved. The right-to-left reading direction of Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga is still a standard method seen in modern manga and novels in Japan. Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga is also credited as the oldest work of manga. As opened, the first scroll illustrates anthropomorphic rabbits and monkeys bathing and getting ready for a ceremony, a monkey thief runs from animals with sticks and knocks over a frog from the lively ceremony. Further on, the rabbits and monkeys are playing and wrestling while another group of animals participate in a funeral and frog prays to Buddha as the scroll closes. | Location created: Kozanji, Kyoto, Japan | Date created: 12th century CE | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on paper | Measurements: Height: 30.5 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: In handscrolls such as Jigoku zoshi (Hell Scrolls), designed to remind one of the penalties of a sinful life, various Buddhist hells are depicted in great detail. The Buddhist concept of the Six Paths of Transmigration (J. rokudô) became popular at the end of the Heian period (794-1185) as the Heian court began to lose its power and social anxiety increased. The hells are one of the six realms to which a person is consigned after death as a result of his or her deeds during this life. The painting probably caused its viewers to shudder with fear and foreboding, encouraging them to embrace the desire to be born into the Pure Land. | Location created: Japan | Date created: Late 12th century CE | Current location: Tokyo National Museum | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on silk | Measurements: 26.9 x 249.3 cm</Description>

We also see the outside tea garden (roji), with stepping stones (tobi-ishi) that create attractive patterns on the ground, protect the guests' footwear from mud and moisture, and direct their footsteps. Guests walking slowly on the uneven stones are compelled to focus on the path. | Location created: Kyoto, Japan | Date created: 1638 CE | Current location: Kyoto, Japan | Medium: Architecture </Description>

Above the guest entrance is a shoji window (window frames covered by paper). Tatami mats are seen on the floor below. The tea house at Daitoku-ji is an excellent example of the wabi aesthetic, which values simplicity, austerity, and understatement. | Location created: Kyoto, Japan | Date created: 1638 CE | Current location: Kyoto, Japan | Medium: Architecture | Measurements: X</Description>

        <Description>Description: Daitoku-ji is a Buddhist temple, one of the branches of the Rinzai school of Japanese Zen, located in Kyoto, Japan. In this view, we see the interior of the Tea House. To the left, we also see the host's entrance (sadouguchi), which leads to the room (mizuya) where the tea is prepared. The cedar post, known as the "heart post," is deliberately prized for its unfinished, slightly bent appearence. The heart post symbolizes the relationship between house and earth, and by extension, the bond between humankind and nature. The tea house at Daitoku-ji is an excellent example of the wabi aesthetic, which values simplicity, austerity, and understatement. | Location created: Kyoto, Japan | Date created: 1638 CE | Current location: Kyoto, Japan | Medium: Architecture | Measurements: X</Description>

        <Description>Description: Daisen-in is a subtemple of Daitoku-ji, a temple of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism. Daisen-in was founded by Zen priest Kogaku Soko, and built between 1509 and 1513. Daisen-in is noted for its Zen garden, pictured here. This garden conjures up a landscape painting in three dimensions. In the background, carefully selected rocks suggest mountains, a flat slab in the middle ground brings to mind a bridge, while underneath a stream of white gravel flows into a broad 'river' dotted with 'islands.' Daisen-in, similar to other dry landscape gardens, is designed for external contemplation, and not for walking around in. Viewers meditate on the tranquil scene from perimeter viewpoints. The concept of this garden teases the mind like a Zen riddle.   | Location created: Kyoto, Japan | Date created: Early 16th century CE | Current location: Kyoto, Japan | Medium:  X | Measurements: 12 x 47 feet</Description>

Daisen-in was founded by Zen priest Kogaku Soko, and built between 1509 and 1513. Daisen-in is noted for its Zen garden, pictured here. In zen gardens, white sand and gravel represent water, or, like the negative space in Japanese paintings, emptiness and distance. In this specific garden, the raked white gravel represents the waves of a vast ocean.  | Location created: Kyoto, Japan | Date created: Early 16th century CE | Current location: Kyoto, Japan </Description>

        <Description>Description: Flowers and birds were a popular subject in ancient Chinese paintings, and the subject experienced a revivial with the Kano School in Japan. By expanding the repertoire of the Kano artists to include boldly rendered brushwork and bright colors, Kano Masanobu's (1434-1530) son Kano Motonobu (1476-1559) widened the school's appeal and devised a style that combined ancient Chinese subjects with native Japanese interests.    | Location created: China | Date created: Late 15th or early 16th century CE |  Medium:  Paint on sliding door | Measurements: 570 x 56 in</Description>
