        <abstract>Corporate Governance practices of MFIs (Microfinance Institutions) across different economies have been known to affect the firm performance. This study explores the practices and key board features (Audit Committees, Independent Directors, International Directors, CEO-Board Chairman duality, Board Size and Director’s Skills) that may have effect on the financial performance of ‘for profit’ MFIs in India. The study identifies Board Size and presence of International Directors to have negative impact on the profitability of MFIs while the Directors’ financial skills are found to have a positive impact on the profitability. No effect of CEO-Board Chairman dual role and audit committees was found on the MFI profitability.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this thesis, a characterization system for semiconductor materials was designed, fabricated, and tested. The capabilities of this setup include measuring photoluminescence emission at a single location of a sample, as well as performing spatially resolved “micro-photoluminescence” measurements throughout a region on the surface of the sample. A number of Gallium Arsenide semiconductor samples were examined in order to validate this testing setup. A Gallium Arsenide sample with known features was fabricated and tested using the spatially resolved imaging capability in order to determine the minimum defect and feature sizes that could be detected. After performing a number of different spatially resolved photoluminescence tests on this sample, photoluminescence blocking features of as small as 10 microns were detected (the smallest of the fabricated features), and the effective focused laser spot size was determined to be on the order of 100 microns. Optimal testing parameters and settings for both standard and spatially resolved PL were determined experimentally. This setup can be used to characterize the relevant performance characteristics, such as material uniformity, defect location, and variations in doping concentration in semiconductor materials for use in photovoltaics and other devices.</abstract>

        <abstract>VICTIMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE: FROM SPOILS OF WAR TO FULL SUBJECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW Evolution of the Criminalization of War Time Rape from 1945 to the Present and the Gendered Perspective on Human Security. Women’s legal status in times of war has historically been that of objects available to the conquering males; sexual violence perpetrated on those spoils of war (or in Latin, Praeda Preda) was a legitimate prerogative of the combatant and a victor’s right. It was not until two major intra-state wars confounded the international community both by their intensity and their brutality that the latter’s transformation into full subjects of international law occurred. This paper seeks to analyze the evolution of the legal status of victims of wartime sexual violence that has resulted from legal developments of the past twenty years. It explores their shift from objects to subjects of international law as having occurred within the context of the emergence of an individualized perspective on security. Contending that supranational criminal prosecution is crucial to preventing the systemic use of sexual violence in current and mostly intra-state conflicts, it also argues favor of the creation of an engendered human security paradigm informed by norms of refugee, human rights and humanitarian law as a legal tool against impunity.</abstract>

        <abstract>Psychiatric disorders, such as depression and other mood disorders, have a high comorbidity with drug use disorders. Research has led to the study of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway as a key site for the comorbidity of the two diseases because chronic stress and drug abuse alter dopamine (DA) release in a similar manner. Two different intensities of social defeat stress, brief or moderate, can be used as a model to induce depressive-like symptoms and study the alterations of the DAergic system by examining the behavioral effects, the changes in DA in the nucleus accumbens in response to an amphetamine injection, as well as cocaine taking behavior. Male mice were exposed to ten days of social defeat stress, with behaviors during the defeats analyzed from days 1 and 10, and then either took part in in vivo microdialysis or cocaine self-administration. Stressed mice show an increased change in DA in response to a d-amphetamine challenge, with moderately stressed mice showing a longer-lasting effect. Stressed mice also take more cocaine on an FR schedule and briefly stressed mice display defensive behaviors more frequently than moderately stressed mice. The intensities of social defeat stress can produce distinct effects on DA, drug taking, and behavior.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper reports work on a catalog that includes not only standard metadata but also a complete reference transcription for each work so that users can explicitly cite not only every version but also every word in every version of a work. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records conceptual model (FRBR) allows us to move beyond printed books and to track the logical units within (and often across) printed books: works (e.g., the Iliad) and expressions (e.g., versions such as the 10th century Venetus A manuscript or Butler’s English translation). The Canonical Text Services (CTS) Data Model builds upon FRBR, allowing us to cite each word in any version of a text and to do so by building upon established citation schemes inherited from print (e.g., the chapter/verse citation scheme in the Bible). This paper describes a concrete implementation of such a catalogue of 3,679 Greek and Latin works that includes FRBR inspired metadata and TEI XML transcriptions that were revised to facilitate implementing a CTS API. It also describes how all the different versions of a work can be serialized as variations on the reference version. The FRBR+CTS catalog provides data by which text reuse and alignment services can automatically detect different versions of and quotations from the reference text, aligning all discovered instances according to a canonical citation scheme.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Greek or Latin literature in translation course is useful yet problematic. It offers a glimpse into the subject to entice first year students and to edify nonmajors. Instructors, however, are left with the task of attempting to contextualize and explain works to their Greekless and Latinless students without the aid of the original language to differentiate ideas. It is certainly possible to cover large concepts, such as μῆνις. If, however, the word ‘anger’ appears past the first line of the Iliad, how is a student to know if it represents μῆνις or something else which should impact their understanding the passage? Similarly, if given two different translations of the same text, how can a student judge the relative merit of those translations without knowledge of the original? In an academic environment where undergraduates are being encouraged to conduct original research earlier, educators can not simply provide translations minus understanding of the original language without robbing their students of vital information that could spur them on to further work. This paper documents a class wherein we attempted to bridge the gap between the translations and Greek texts. Our goal was not only to introduce our students to the works and the world where they originated but to also provoke critical thought and allow our students to engage directly with the original texts. Using a series of three projects, we demonstrated to the students how they could tackle and begin to understand an unfamiliar language via tools freely available on the internet. Based on our experiences teaching this class and reactions gathered from our students, we propose a new potential model for literature in translation courses.</abstract>

        <abstract>Este trabajo analizará algunas características del género distópico en Latinoamérica a partir del análisis de tres novelas en particular: Ygdrasil (2005) de Jorge Baradit (Chile), La ley del amor (1996) de Laura Esquivel (México) y Que Dios se apiade de todos nosotros (1993) de Ricardo Guzmán Wolffer (México). El trabajo se organizará en torno a tres núcleos conceptuales: la representación de lo político, la representación de la religión y la mitología y la representación de la tecnología. Muchas distopías se basan en sistemas políticos reales o tendencias políticas peligrosas que nota el autor. Por otra parte, la religión y la mitología incluyen un elemento persistente que ha existido desde hace miles de años y sigue como elemento importante en las sociedades futuras examinadas. Los avances tecnológicos y sus consecuencias forman parte de cada concepto futurístico, es uno de los cambios más obvios que hemos visto a lo largo de la historia y las proyecciones futurísticas imaginan el desarrollo de productos y habilidades que todavía no existen. Estos libros, como ejemplos del género distópico, son críticas de la sociedad. Las variadas interpretaciones del género reflejan las diversas experiencias de la gente a través del mundo pero también los miedos subyacentes que nos unen. Los tres libros seleccionados presentan elementos en común con las novelas distópicas icónicas pero también incluyen elementos propiamente americanos como mitología indígena y referencias a la historia de la conquista. El resultado es una práctica del género que construye su sentido tanto a partir de la tradición del género como de elementos propios de la historia y la realidad latinoamericanas, incluyendo simultáneamente lo local y lo universal.</abstract>

        <abstract>Brazil has experienced a significant increase in political power and economic strength over the past decade, allowing a growing number of Brazilians to leave poverty and to enjoy higher living standards. However, this change has not affected all Brazilians equally, with millions still living in favelas and facing marginalization and stigmatization on a daily basis. This thesis begins by discussing the characteristics of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and their residents and moves to analyze the causes of discrimination against favela residents, including race and gender, and the criminalization of individuals living in favelas. The thesis moves to explore violence in the public and private spheres in the favelas and the way in which the authorities use it as a justification for police operations to restore order in the favelas. It then discusses the growth of violent and organized crime in certain favelas, as well as the state’s reaction via military police operations, women’s police stations, and Pacifying Police Units, and its effectiveness at responding to violence. Finally, the thesis turns to the responses of favela residents and community organizations, and argues that these groups have had some success in attracting the attention of domestic and international audiences through the use of mainstream and social media, in raising awareness of incidents of police brutality and discrimination, and in obtaining a response from state authorities. However, the state still needs to fill many gaps in order to fully integrate favela residents into Brazilian society and to put an end to policies that exclude these individuals. Brazil’s recent growth in political and economic power therefore represents an opportunity for the state to address its legacy of marginalization and discrimination and to formulate policies that will make the country more inclusive of all its citizens</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper looks beyond the medical narrative of transgender and gender nonconforming identities and demonstrates how members of the trans community define sex and gender through their own lived experiences. The experiences of those who participated in the study demonstrate that sex and gender are two separate forms of identity that each individual negotiates in their own life. These components of human identity intersect, but they are not interdependent. Therefore, the experiences of my trans participants represent that embodying a normatively incongruent sex and gender is the essence of congruency with their authentic selves.</abstract>

        <abstract>Examining the "Penguin Revolution" of 2006, the largest social mobilization in Chile since the return to civilian rule in 1990, I argue that the Chilean student movement reconstituted itself by developing a grassroots “assembliest” logic that while drawing on the legacy of the traditional Left as a critical ideological referent, nonetheless marked a departure from the more hierarchical, vanguardist organizational forms that characterized the latter. Throughout, I underscore the role of popular culture, particularly punk and hip hop subcultures, as an alternative “circuit of socialization” for this new popular Left. I contend that popular culture, oral tradition, and direct experience form a kind of “organic ideology” that provides the scaffolding for more systematic political critique. In this vein, I argue that the key protagonists in this process are grassroots colectivos that often emerge from these subcultures and are critical in synthesizing this “organic ideology” with elements of radical Left theory to form new forms of political praxis.</abstract>

        <abstract>Like all social animals, pigeons must be able to recognize and categorize conspecific behavior to respond appropriately. Previous studies with digital animated models have indicated that pigeons are able to discriminate on the basis of action categories. In this experiment, two pigeons were trained to discriminate between video clips depicting different categories of pigeon behavior. In a go/no-go procedure, pigeons responded to video clips of conspecifics walking or courting in the motion condition, or random static frames from the same videos in the static condition. Stimuli were conditionally reinforced so that walking was positive and courtship was negative in the motion condition, with reversed assignments in the static condition. The purpose of the conditional reinforcement was to analyze the relative importance of motion cues based on the difference in performance on the two conditions. Both pigeons learned the dynamic discrimination faster and more accurately than the static discrimination. Transfer tests were conducted to further explore which cues were important in the discrimination of the videos. One pigeon demonstrated partial transfer of the motion discrimination to new videos of each behavior. Both pigeons demonstrated strong transfer to videos played in reverse and to videos with randomized frame order, and no transfer to blurred videos. These results indicate that the pigeons did not use motion cues in the discrimination, and that having multiple frames in the dynamic condition but only a single frame in the static condition may have caused them to discriminate videos better than images. These results imply that pigeons discriminate actions in recorded videos in a different manner than actions of digital models.</abstract>

        <abstract>My study seeks to recognize and substantiate the value of gender diversity on Supreme Court jurisprudence. Specifically, I explored the impact of female Justices on oral argument, from the behavior and treatment of the Justices to the content of their arguments. Using cases from the first two terms of each of the four female Justices who have served on the Court, I studied both the behavior and treatment of those Justices in order to better understand the dynamics of the Court in which they exist. I then studied the insertion of their perspectives into the oral arguments of gender cases. Much of their behavior on the Court, from the amount that they speak to the number of times they are interrupted, exhibits their confidence and willingness to engage with their colleagues. The presence of many “perspective statements” throughout the broad swath of gender cases I examined also demonstrates that female Justices are unafraid to link their identity with their speech when it comes to gender cases. My study demonstrates that a value does lie in the specific contribution of women to the Court. The white, male lens should not be considered a neutral perspective, but instead one among many perspectives that can contribute to a better understanding of the impact of our laws on the individual rights of our citizenry. The increased representation of women on the Supreme Court, and on every court, will make huge strides towards ensuring the representation of those interests in the laws of our country.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis analyzes three hypotheses of ways in which the use of cognitive heuristics could lead to suboptimal decision making in the National Football League (NFL) draft. In the first hypothesis, teams draft more players from schools with high-caliber players due to the availability heuristic. This bias is found and is shown to be detrimental to teams. The second hypothesis contends that the availability heuristic will lead teams to overdraft from their local state. Analysis shows that between a fourth and a third of NFL teams draft local players too often, but this does not have any negative effect on performance. The final hypothesis argues that teams will use a mental representation of an NFL player when drafting, even if the mental representation is flawed. This hypothesis is confirmed for quarterbacks, where teams miss a key signal, but is found to be false for offensive skill players, who teams draft based on the correct cues. Prescriptive recommendations are outlined on how teams can avoid biased decision-making processes in the future.</abstract>

        <abstract>In 2013, Abdi Warsame was elected to Minneapolis City Council, becoming the highest ranking Somali in the United States and usurping three-time incumbent Robert Lilligren. His election came on the heels of a transformation of the redistricting process in the City of Minneapolis and an endorsement from the largest party in Minneapolis, the Democratic Farmer Labor Party (DFL). This thesis is divided into two parts. The first section reveals and explores the systems of power constructed by white, male,heterosexual interests that are present and operating in Minneapolis city politics. Specifically, I focus on how the influence of powerful special interests in Warsame's election and the lack of multicultural literacy in the Minneapolis DFL almost cost Warsame the DFL endorsement and have potentially altered his decisions after election within City Hall. The second section is focused on how the Somali community, as led by Warsame, was able to overcome these structures of power through their use of innovative grassroots organizing methods. In particular, I center on the new application of the Get Out The Vote method and reliance on alternative media outlets. As such, Warsame's story, although unique, illuminates some of the invisible structures of power present in many cities politics that operate, exclude, and manipulate newcomers and marginalized communities while providing strategies and methods for other disenfranchised communities seeking political power to overcome these barriers in their own communities.</abstract>

        <abstract>Epilepsy is a disease that is characterized by increased neural activity resulting in recurrent seizures. The development of epilepsy occurs during a period of gradual brain alterations called epileptogenesis, which can result from a precipitating event such as head trauma or an initial seizure event called status epilepticus (SE) or it can occur naturally due to genetic predisposition. Our lab previously identified a correlation between epileptogenesis after chemically induced SE and increased Wnt signaling in the hippocampus, a primary region implicated in temporal lobe epilepsies. The additional observation that expression of HBP1, a Wnt repressor, decreased during this period led us to hypothesize that HBP1 may be a causal agent in epileptogenesis. A literature search revealed a gene block containing HBP1 and eight other genes that when deleted was significantly correlated with increased chance of developing seizures. We created an HBP1 knockout strain of mice, compared its phenotype to that of the clinical patients, and found that the mouse model preserved the increased seizure susceptibility, incomplete penetrance, and development of spontaneous seizures. This data suggests that an HBP1 deletion might be the cause of seizures in these patients. To test if this model could be extended further, we looked at the molecular pathways altered in the knockout mice and found that both the mTor and Wnt signaling pathways were upregulated, which is consistent with alterations observed during epileptogenesis in models of temporal lobe epilepsies. If further investigation reveals that this model is in fact a more general model for epilepsy, it can be used to aid in both the treatment and diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsies.</abstract>

        <abstract>This study examines the potential use of functional near­infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a measure of brain activity, and electrocardiogram (ECG), a measure of heart rate, as physiological sensors that can determine a user’s cognitive workload and emotional valence. Eight participants wore both sensors simultaneously, and completed two tasks. In one task, they performed a working memory task known as n­back, which can be used to manipulate cognitive workload. In the other task, they viewed a series of images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), which are documented as evoking known emotional responses. Using the support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm, a classifier was generated for each subject for each condition and was evaluated using 10­fold cross validation. Results show that the fNIRS classifiers performed significantly better on the workload data than the ECG classifiers. For the emotion data, one of the ECG classifiers performed slightly better than the fNIRS classifiers. Both devices could be used as passive input sources for creating adaptive computer interfaces. Although each device was evaluated separately, the two could be used in conjunction to better classify a user’s state.</abstract>

        <abstract>Neurons are a primary functional component of the brain and nervous system. During development, axons explore their surrounding and form synapses with dendrites of other neurons. The growth of the axon is directed by numerous mechanical and chemical cues, which have not been described in a fully quantitative model. Here the Fokker-Planck equation and an effective potential are used to quantitatively describe the net effect of the guidance cues. The velocity of growth is written using polar coordinates, to separate the speed and angle of growth. On glass, the effective potential for speed is found to be V-shaped, while the effective potential for the angle is found be sinusoidal, indicating the existence of regulatory mechanisms beyond simple diffusion. The effects of directional surfaces made from PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) with an anisotropic ratchet structure are also investigated. The ratchet structure imparts directionality to the growth, with the neurons primarily growing over the ridges of the ratchet structure with roughly the same amplitude as the growth cone.</abstract>

        <abstract>There is a demonstrated need for an aerial reconnaissance glider that can disappear without a trace. To fill this need, a frangible glider was developed with a rigid airframe made up of many component pieces held together in compression by a tension member. The airframe can be triggered to fall apart into its component pieces by severing the tension member. The primary failure modes of the glider were identified and a mathematical model of the wing was developed to better analyze these failure modes. The model indicated that tipping failure due to an applied moment on the wing causing separation between the wing and the body of the glider was the most likely cause of failure. Experiments were performed to test whether the model accurately portrayed failure of the wing, and to test the flight characteristics of the glider prototype. It was found that the experimental and mathematical data had similar curves although they differed at what moment caused initial tipping by about 1 lb*in. The flight test showed that many components of the glider can fail to perform correctly and better integration of glider components was necessary. However, it was demonstrated that the frangible airframe concept is a viable product.</abstract>

        <abstract>In 2008 a unique sedimentary unit of red sandstone with abundant calcite nodules was discovered within the northeast corner of the Narragansett Basin in southeastern Massachusetts. Although the outcrop of the calcite nodules examined in this paper was destroyed in 2010, the nodules collected in 2008 were interpreted preliminarily as calcite rhizoliths representing a preserved root horizon (Benner and Gardulski, 2010). The calcite nodule-rich unit lies stratigraphically below a dated rhyolite flow (Late Devonian, ~373 Ma; Thompson and Hermes, 2003) and is within the “lower portion” of the Wamsutta Formation, beneath an unconformity with the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Wamsutta Formation. The outcrop area was investigated to determine whether the calcite features represent rhizoliths within a paleosol, possibly preserving an early, deeply rooted (~3m thick) plant ecosystem within a pyroclastic deposit. Petrographic analysis revealed an abundance of devitrified glass within the matrix of these samples as well as pumice and lithic fragments suggesting a volcanic origin of the deposit. Scanning electron microscopy revealed amorphous carbon fragments within all of the sample types, which supports a biogenic origin of the calcite nodules. Combining this microscopic data with stratigraphic fieldwork it was confirmed that most of the calcite nodules are preserved rhizoliths within a pyroclastic deposit from at least the Late Devonian.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper aims to identify the variables that drive workers off of their labor supply curves in the Vietnamese apparel factories monitored by the Better Work initiative of the International Labor Organization. It is assumed that firm managers can use various non-wage incentives or punishments to shift a worker’s labor supply curve. A theoretical model of worker behavior is developed, incorporating insights from psychology. The empirical analysis quantitatively assesses the impact of non-wage variables on labor supply. The analysis estimates that 22% of overtime hours worked in the Vietnamese firms surveyed result from employer-driven shifts of the labor supply curve and can thus be considered involuntary. That figure rises to 24% when extending the definition of involuntary overtime to include hours overtime hours worked as a result of low levels of base pay.</abstract>

        <abstract>Participants were simultaneously in a within/between subjects design measuring perceived humor across two conditions: one in which a joke-teller told five ethnic stereotype jokes and one in which the joke teller told five neutral jokes. The experiment was double blind. For each joke and scenario participants indicated whether they were amused, disgusted, laughed, smiled, thought the scenario was wrong, and thought the scenario was not wrong. There were two main effects found across joke teller conditions, such that participants were less likely to smile and more likely to call a Jewish joke wrong (p&lt;.05). We also found a significant interaction for laughter, such that participants that were not Jewish were more likely to laugh at a Jewish joke told by a Jew than they were when the joke was told by a Christian (p&lt;.05). These results indicate that not only is joke teller key in perceived humor (i.e. laughter) of an ethnic disparagement joke, but so is the audience. Further research could determine if the audience being an in-group verse an out-group would change these outcomes.</abstract>

        <abstract>The formula for what people need to thrive is not complex: access to work, education, safety and clean air. These fundamental goods do not mean anything unless people have the political and economic ability to harness them. Cities have historically been seen as the provider of this access for the masses, but white communities have consistently benefited at the expense of communities of color. Further, the lack of equity in access has not been the result of chance but rather conscious choices made by the power brokers who direct urban development. The history of development is one of inequity, but this is not to say that equitable development is impossible. As seen through various case studies in the Boston metro-region, while the past 75 years are strewn with cases of unequal development decisions, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in the language of development to one that emphasizes equity. Now, the challenge is to identify the structural roadblocks to implementation and plan in an integrated manner for a more equitable future.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have built models to explain how dynamic physiological networks store information about anatomical shape. We model planarian regeneration through an agent-based model (ABM) paradigm, in which each cell is a simulated agent with a set of procedural behaviors that exchange basic information. Storage of spatial information is explained in the model by the exchange of directional vectors that travel semi-randomly, cataloging paths across the body. This enables a non-local and nonspecific storage of the worm’s morphology within any given region of sufficient size.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis asks how everyday is experienced and understood after sexual violence. In the first chapter, I ask how the concept of rape culture has influenced activist and scholarly approaches to sexual violence, and what we might learn by encountering people who have experienced sexual violence in not only a rape culture, but also a sensorium of sexual violence that takes seriously feelings of everyday life. In the second chapter, I focus on experiences of traumatic triggers in order to ask how the aftermath of sexual violence is embodied through sensory, felt experiences. In the final chapter, I focus on communication and community in order to ask how people may work together to prevent sexual violence and make the world more livable for those who have already experienced it.</abstract>

        <abstract>The development of highly accurate, strategic-grade sensors is integral for the development of Inertial Navigation Systems (IMUs). Currently, sensors which make up IMUs are limited by bandwidth, size, and stability. The Zero Force Accelerometer (ZFA) aims to exceed these specifications as the next generation of high precision sensor. It is necessary then to mitigate any source of error in order to increase the integrity of the device. Small displacement error, temperature drift and variable analog inputs call for an in-situ scale factor calculation, but at a cost. In particular, a g-dependent term was observed, propagating to 61,599 ppm/g. A new algorithm was proposed exploiting changing parameters on the fly, and calculating and combining two scale factor measurements to eliminate the g-dependency. The results showed two orders of magnitude improvement of scale factor error (311.43 ppm/g), but still does meet strategic-grade specifications, so further study is desired.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the industrialized world, states with large Catholic populations have enfranchised women on average 20-30 years later than states that are predominantly Protestant. The prevailing explanation for this phenomenon is largely cultural; Catholic doctrine creates strictly traditional roles for women and creates a culture of female oppression. This paper will show that in the French example, the delay in suffrage was actually caused by the parties of the Left who feared that the mass influx of highly religious and very conservative female voters would upset the fragile framework of the French government and would increase the political power of conservative parties. Conversely, the Catholic Church and Catholic Parties were the strongest supporters of the female vote because women tended to align themselves with the policies and parties of the Church. This resulted in a paradox in which the Catholic Church was the strongest supporter of female suffrage, and the ideologically progressive Leftist parties worked to suppress the female vote. Following female enfranchisement in 1944 under Charles de Gaulle, women were indeed more conservative and more religious voters than men. From the 1960s through the present, however, women have become dramatically less religious, and have accordingly shifted in ideology from the Right to the Left. This ideological shift coincides with increased female participation in the workforce and union membership, secularization and modernization of French society and economy, but ultimately is rooted in increased access to higher education amongst women in France.</abstract>

        <abstract>Due to the emergence of alternatives to petroleum as economically viable transportation fuels, the value of petroleum resources are likely to become threatened over time, and this paper proposes that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia begin a long-term program to reduce the dominance of oil as its principal source of economic activity. With high oil prices making this difficult, it is believed that the Kingdom’s long-term interest lies in proactively pushing oil prices down, in order to maximize long-term profits, reduce price volatility risks, and provide increasing incentives to government and private decision-makers to diversify the Kingdom’s economy.</abstract>

        <abstract>Previous research has proven people commit the conjunction fallacy because of stereotype-use. Additionally, previous research has demonstrated that mood effects stereotype-use. The current study investigates mood effects on stereotype-based conjunction probability judgments under the classical and quantum probability theory. Forty undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to either a sad or neutral mood condition. All participants then answered 32 questions about the probabilities of individuals from difference races and genders experiencing adverse educational outcomes. The results show individuals committed the conjunction fallacy for minority females when under the sad mood condition. Also, individuals tended to commit the conjunction fallacy for minority males when they were under the sad mood condition. There were close to significant results for differences in mood conditions of participants when they made probability judgments about minority females and white females. Lastly, individuals tended to make higher probability judgments under the sad mood condition than under the neutral mood condition. Stereotype-use was demonstrated and the conjunction fallacy was committed. The present results are more consistent with the stereotype-use explanation of the conjunction fallacy.</abstract>

        <abstract>This project is about mass-mediated lesbian identity and the ambiguous politics of lesbian visibility as expressed in the realm of professional cooking. In recent years, mass-media outlets such as the Food Network have turned chefs into celebrities. Central to this trend has been the rise of competitive cooking shows, like Iron Chef America and Chopped, where chefs duel with one another in pseudo-athletic settings. These outlets have made a long-standing relationship, dating back to the French creation of professional cooking, even more explicit: food, cuisine, and identity are necessarily linked. In this context, where lines between self and food are increasingly unclear, the figure of the lesbian chef is being created, represented, and circulated to an ever-expanding audience. Among the many possible expressions of queerness, these venues are selecting a few token images as exchangeable signs of lesbianism in the market.</abstract>

        <abstract>As global warming and pollution are becoming an ever increasing problem, the need to move to green and renewable sources for energy is becoming more and more important. Solar cells, having a wide range of uses and having already shown potential for mass marketability, are key to moving away from fossil fuels and natural gas as the main sources of energy production. Consequentially, it has also become necessary to reduce both the capital and energy costs of solar cell manufacturing. In this research, only cheap and abundant resources were used along with non-energy intensive processing through electrodeposition in the development of solar cells. Special focus was dedicated to optimizing the deposition of zinc oxide (ZnO) to improve the efficiency of the solar cell. The optimal methodology was the deposition of zinc metal first, followed by the formation of ZnO by annealing the zinc metal film. Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) was then deposited on top of the ZnO as a means of creating an effective p-n heterojunction. However, due to deposition difficulties, it was not possible to construct an effective p-n junction. Nevertheless, the most effective ZnO deposition process was successfully characterized.</abstract>

        <abstract>Approximately 30 human hereditary diseases have been linked to large-scale expansions of repetitive microsatellites, such as the (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. Discovering how these repeats are expanding is central to the understanding of the disease progression in human pedigrees. While previous work with (GAA)n repeats has shed light on how these large-scale expansions are occurring, this work has yet to be expanded to include (CAG)¬n repeat expansions. In order to unravel this mechanism, we used a budding yeast model system in which (CAG)140 repeats were artificially integrated into two different cassettes to allow for recovery of large-scale expansions. Upon creating the cassettes, we were able to knock out both the Srs2 and Tof1 proteins to see their effect on repeat expansions. Additionally, we conducted a transposon mutagenesis screen to uncover genes involved in large-scale repeat expansions. Our work with these mutant yeast strains has provided us with evidence of the difference between (CAG)n repeat expansions and other trinucleotide repeats, supporting the balancing hypothesis of repeat expansions.</abstract>

        <abstract>In my thesis, I will conduct a comparative analysis of the wartime and exilic narratives written by three contemporary female Iraqi authors. Through a close reading of Betool Khedairi’s two novels Absent (2004) and A Sky So Close (2001), Mikhail’s poetical memoir Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea (2009), and al-Radi’s autobiographical journal Baghdad Diaries (1998), I will assess the extent to which the experiences of war and exile elicit a renegotiation of gender roles for the female protagonists in their works. For the Iraqi women who they portray in their texts, both the 1990-91 Gulf War and the subsequent period of exile bring about certain voids, which serve as windows of opportunity for them to subvert conventional gendered hierarchies and assert themselves through various modes of creative expression. In the absence of their husbands during the war, these female characters take on new roles and responsibilities within their households that empower them. Likewise, the departure from their native countries and traditions while living in exile allows them increased freedom of expression and mobility. Hence, both war and exile dismantle traditional relationships and power dynamics, enabling the female characters in these works to renegotiate their identities. Furthermore, through the very act of writing, Khedairi, Mikhail, and al-Radi exert their authority as Iraqi women during the Gulf War and in exile thereafter. The publication of their texts revolutionized Iraq’s literary tradition, transforming it to include the female narrative. Thus, these female authors exemplify the very societal reconstruction that they illustrate through the content of their works, using their writing to reconfigure the cultural fabric of Iraqi society.</abstract>

        <abstract>Since the crossover success of Blueprint 3 established Jay Z as a global pop star, the drug dealer turned mogul has come to embody the American Dream, continuing a tradition of rags-to-riches storytelling which has always enthralled American audiences. As a Black man the rapper exemplifies not just the possibility of class mobility but also racial advancement. His individual success, however, obscures the systemic racism which confines so many African Americans to a permanent underclass. Through a close analysis of the rapper’s music, this paper identifies the ways that the American culture industry shapes Jay Z's American Dream narrative to perpetuate neoliberal values and obscure Black disenfranchisement.</abstract>

        <abstract>Even though there is precipitation in Boston an average of 127 days out of the year, there have been few efforts to measure particulate air pollution during rainstorms in Boston. During rainstorms, particle number concentration (PNC), which is an air pollutant associated with cardiovascular disease, and meteorological conditions both change. It is unclear, however, if the rainfall itself or the changes in meteorological conditions cause PNC to change. The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify the changes in PNC, temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction during rainstorms; (2) to construct a multivariate linear regression model to determine how PNC is associated with rainstorm duration; and (3) to determine which meteorological conditions are associated with changes in PNC during rainstorms. The study was performed at the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) Air Pollution Monitoring Site in Roxbury, Massachusetts. PNC and meteorological conditions (temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall rate) were measured at five-minute intervals from September 9, 2013 through March 12, 2014. A multivariate linear regression model and a time series of rainstorms were constructed. Average PNC during rainy weather was measured to be 8% less than average PNC during dry weather (p&lt;0.001). In general, PNC levels decreased throughout rainstorms at a rate of 15%/hour. A multivariate linear regression model estimated that rainfall was associated with PNC removal at an average rate of 12%/hour. A comparison of the simple linear regression model and the multivariate linear regression model indicated that the decrease in PNC associated with rainfall duration is associated with the rainfall itself and not other meteorological conditions.</abstract>

        <abstract>With approximately 24% of Americans consuming or living with someone who consumes gluten-free products, whether due to wheat allergy, wheat or gluten intolerance, Celiac Disease, a perceived healthier diet, or other reasons, the $10.5 billion gluten-free market is one that is attaining an increasing pervasive influence in the United States. Due to uncertainties surrounding the stringency and adherence to labeling regulations for gluten-free status, four major gluten-free certification programs have emerged in the U.S. The objective of this study was to answer two questions: (1) whether or not consumers of gluten-free bread are willing to pay a premium for certification, and (2) if so, how much of a premium they are willing to pay. To this end, a contingent valuation survey using the payment card method was used, along with Tobit and logit analyses. Results indicated a 55% probability of paying a premium and an average magnitude of $1.12 over the mean $6.00 price tag for gluten-free bread. Shopping venue, income, frequency of purchase, number of children, area of residence, and purchasing decision factors such as certification status, price, and consideration of the use of a dedicated facility during manufacturing processes had significant influences on both the probability of paying a premium and the size of such a premium.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis seeks to understand the naturalization choices of Chinese and Indian immigrants in the United States. I focus in particular on the association between ethnic neighborhoods (or enclaves) and naturalization outcomes. Using microdata from the 2011 American Community Survey, I explore the impact of individual and neighborhood attributes on (a) the probability of an immigrant being naturalized and (b) how soon an eligible immigrant chooses to naturalize. My analysis produces mixed results with regards to the neighborhood variable: depending on the model specification and immigrant group in question, the coefficient of living in or near an ethnic enclave is positive but not always significant. The individual attribute variables confirm the findings of previous literature. One exception is the dummy variable of having children, which I find to be negatively correlated with the probability of naturalization.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper explores the economic determinants and outcomes of verbal abuse in developing country garment factories. The first question addressed is if and how verbal abuse derives from firm incentive structures. The second question is whether abuse is profitable. The purpose is to understand the hypothesized existence of a business case for verbal abuse. A model is developed to incorporate verbal abuse as an integral component of firm motivational structure wherein supervisors employ verbal exhortation to encourage higher production levels from the workforce. The proposed theory contends that, in the absence of an incentivizing piece-rate wage, workers will be subject to increased levels of verbal abuse to deter shirking behavior. If it is demonstrated that verbal exhortation leads to high levels of productivity from a worker, then it could possibly be the case that firms are profit-maximizing in their decision to pay workers hourly and take a tolerant stance toward verbal abuse (contingent on the degree of presumed disutility workers suffer from being abused). Alternately, if verbal abuse is found to have negative profitability implications, firms would be acting sub-optimally and would have an incentive to better monitor the abuse. Results from analysis of firm incentive structures confirm that supervisors do use verbal abuse as a supplementary motivational tool. However, results also refute the possibility for a business case, demonstrating that verbal abuse has detrimental implications for firm profits, both by negatively impacting worker productivity and generating a costly compensating differential.</abstract>

        <abstract>Linnévatnet, Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard is a proglacial lake with varved sediment. Given pronounced Arctic warming in recent decades, Linnévatnet is a suitable location for paleoclimate studies based on lacustrine sediment. Previous analyses of sediment from Linné have been based in varve counting and thickness; this thesis investigates the data yielded by a new long core technique: XRF spectrometry with a COX Itrax Corescanner. XRF elemental signatures depicted prominent laminations and bands at the top of a transect of three cores taken across the southern end of the lake. Calcium and iron exhibited the strongest correlation with varves at the top of the cores, indicating their potential use as paleoclimate proxies. Laminations thin down-core, so a higher resolution XRF scan than was completed in this study would be needed to accurately distinguish deeper varves via their elemental composition.</abstract>

        <abstract>Two-Way Immersion (TWI) programs represent a model of bilingual education that integrates balanced numbers of English speakers with speakers of a minority language for all aspects of content area instruction, at least half of which is conducted in the minority language, with the aim of fostering complete bilingual and bicultural competence in all students. Ideally, students act as language models and language learners by turns, thereby creating symmetrical immersive environments in each language. TWI has been regarded by experts as the most effective and culturally sensitive means by which to develop bilingual proficiency while simultaneously condoning high levels of academic achievement, allowing students to apply concepts and skills developed in their first language to the second. The present study draws upon data collected through a combination of classroom observations and teacher interviews conducted in the first grade classrooms of a Spanish-English TWI program in order to compare the theoretical ideal of the TWI model with the practical realities of bilingual instruction. Contrary to what one would expect, results indicate that 1) there existed substantive differences in instruction between the two program languages, and 2) the students collectively possessed a lower proficiency in the minority language. The study interprets the findings in light of the linguistic and pedagogical theories underlying TWI and supports research suggesting areas for further investigation with regard to the school- and classroom-level frameworks necessary to promote bilingual proficiency in all students.</abstract>

        <abstract>Stress can play a role in alcohol and substance abuse, but the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this relationship are unclear. The current study pharmacologically tested the role of corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptors (CRF-R1) in ethanol drinking following social defeat stress. Adult, male CFW mice were exposed to either 15 (moderate) or 30 (severe) attack bites for 10 consecutive days using the resident/intruder paradigm. Ten days after the final social defeat, mice were tested for the expression of locomotor sensitization following a 2 g/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) ethanol challenge. Daily, voluntary 20% ethanol and water intake was measured during a 3 week period of continuous access to two bottle free choice. Doses of a CRF-R1 antagonist, CP-376,395 (10, 17, and 30 mg/kg, i.p.), were administered, and ethanol and water drinking were recorded 2, 4, and 24hrs after drug administration for stressed and non-stressed mice. We found that mice that experienced the severe stress, but not the moderate, during social defeat stress period consumed more ethanol than non-stressed controls. CP-376,395 decreased ethanol intake of the high ethanol drinkers in a dose-dependent manner during the initial 2 hours compared to the low ethanol drinkers; after 4 hours the drug effect was only observed at the highest dose. This pattern suggests that more intense and longer social stressors escalate ethanol consumption, but not lower intensity and shorter duration stressors. Previous exposure to ethanol access results in a delayed stress-induced escalation of ethanol drinking. CRF-R1 may play a critical role in mediating stress-induced ethanol consumption. Ongoing studies using an operant conditioning procedure suggest that socially defeated CFW mice have increased motivation for alcohol. It is anticipated that lower HPA axis activation and limbic CRF and dopamine will differentiate the stress mechanisms that engender escalated alcohol consumption.</abstract>

        <abstract>Cyber attacks are an emerging, and often misunderstood, danger to national security. Although nascent and sophisticated threats emanating from cyberspace might appear overwhelming, remarkably, there are sufficient parallels between Jihadist terrorism and cyber attacks that can provide useful insights. Both tactics are nebulous, undefined threats that not only jeopardize wide sections of society, but also, make it straightforward for the perpetrators to conceal their identity. These shared attributes complicate efforts to establish a robust deterrence. Yet, the remote plausibility of high impact attacks underscore why these intricate security concerns cannot be ignored. With these parallels in mind, this paper draws upon the lessons learned from over a decade of fighting terrorism, to endorse the following guidelines for cybersecurity policy and strategy: (1) do not ignore deterrence, but recognize that its applications are limited to fostering resilience and deterring nation-states, (2) synchronize government responses and create a federal office to guide strategic direction, (3) bolster the capabilities of the intelligence community to coordinate and unmask perpetrators, (4) raise public awareness to the best computer security practices and reduce threat inflation, (5) work with the private sector to incentivize cybersecurity and maintain trust, (6) engage internationally to promote global norms on cybersecurity and foster information sharing, and (7) determine the risks of potential cyber and non-cyber responses to an attack as a means to understand the long term implications of short term strategies.</abstract>

        <abstract>"Engaging Persia in the Former Soviet Union" analyzes how American-Iranian interests converge and diverge in Central Asia. Specifically, it focuses on the stability of Afghanistan and the diversification of Central Asian energy economies via Iranian participation in Caspian energy projects. At the height of Soviet prominence, the Soviets monopolized Central Asian energy economies by constructing pipelines that were reliant on Russian transit routes to Europe. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, American policy in the region failed to promote the independence of Central Asia and Azerbaijan by hindering the diversification of Central Asian and Azerbaijani energy economies. Instead, the United States pursued a policy to prioritize the economic and political development of Russia while simultaneously containing Iran. By barring Iranian participation in Caspian Energy projects, America prevents competition and empowers Russian influence in Central Asia. The essay discusses the competing interests of all the major powers in Central Asia (China, Russia, India, Turkey, Iran, America) before exploring how American-Iranian interests converge and diverge in the region. Next, the essay explains how Iranian participation in Caspian energy projects will counter Russian imperialism and mitigate China's rise in the region, thus benefiting American interests. Despite mutual interests, the argument acknowledges and rectifies potentially divergent interests in the Persian Gulf and Central Asia. Next, the thesis identifies the obstacles to a feasible American policy in the region, namely the Saudi and Israeli lobbies. In conclusion, the thesis provides a prescription for a new American policy in the region and discusses the implications of this new approach.</abstract>

        <abstract>Obesity is a rising health concern in the United States, and availability of healthy foods in grocery stores is an important factor. Lacking from the current literature in this area is a culturally specific analysis of what drives food preferences and a consideration of culture in the development of healthy food policies. This study examines the motivations behind food preferences in a specific Latino community in East Somerville. Based on study findings, the discussion section includes policy suggestions to increase availability of healthy foods in the three Latino bodegas of study. Using a quantitative Nutrition Environment Measures Survey for stores (NEMS-S) that I worked on last summer in Guatemala to determine the availability of healthy food options in three Latino bodegas, and qualitative interviews to determine what drives consumer food preferences, I tested three hypotheses: 1. The foods found in the three Latino bodegas will apply more closely to the NEMS-S survey created in Guatemala than the general NEMS-S survey created for U.S. stores, meaning that consumer buying preferences in these stores are molded more by culture of origin than by culture of residence, 2. There will be a general lack of healthy food options in these stores indicated by the results of the NEMS-S surveys, and 3. Consumers will have reasons other than food for why they choose to shop at these stores: e.g. for community, social, and cultural aspects. Results will be used to determine whether healthy food policies are needed in these stores and then to suggest policy options based on consumer preferences.</abstract>

        <abstract>Arguably the most important civil rights issues of contemporary America, the prison industrial complex and mass incarceration disproportionately impact marginalized populations and communities, especially poor communities and people of Color, and has created a second-class citizenship for a growing body of formerly incarcerated people. This thesis explores the political biographies and resistances of three formerly incarcerated men of Color who have survived the criminal injustice system and the systemic violence of prison itself, and despite the odds stacked against them, have become politicized activists, continuing to resist and organize against the dehumanization and oppression of other incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people. In a White Supremacist society that condemns prisoners and formerly incarcerated people of Color, this thesis resists that condemnation and challenges the reader to question dominant narratives about incarceration, criminal injustice, race, and the lives of formerly incarcerated men of Color. Through the voices, stories, and insights of these men of Color, we see in this case study that formerly incarcerated people have much to offer the world, and that given the right opportunities and resources they have incredible capacity to change it.  </abstract>

        <abstract>Decades of work by Black parents and activists in Pittsburgh preceded the process of desegregation, which was an attempt to break down a racist system that maintained separate and unequal schools. There was never full desegregation in Pittsburgh, and in the 1990s a period of resegregation undid some of the changes made under the 1980 desegregation plan. Three phases of resistance to desegregation explain why there was partial desegregation followed by a period of resegregation. The first phase took place at the grassroots level after the Board of Public Education passed a mild desegregation plan in 1971. The main opposition to this plan was a boycott of a predominantly Black school by parents of 47 students from Carrick, a White, working- and middle-class neighborhood. Underlying causes of this boycott included a desire for “neighborhood schools,” racism, and a lack of representation on the Board of Education. No one from Carrick served on the Board, which at the time was appointed by a group of judges. The second phase of resistance to desegregation began with the transition from an appointed Board to an elected Board in 1976. In the new, nine-member elected Board, five White members formed a “conservative faction” that opposed adopting citywide desegregation plan. A more moderate faction of Board members passed a partial desegregation plan in 1980 that focused on magnet schools to create “voluntary” desegregation instead of requiring all students to attend desegregated schools. Part of this plan included “busing” students to schools outside their neighborhoods, which was the target of the third phase of resistance in the mid-1990s. From 1995 to 1998, the Board of Education and state legislature overturned parts of the 1980 desegregation plan. From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, resistance to desegregation mounted what was, in the words of one former superintendent, the “unraveling” of desegregation in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis reviews the history of Chinese science fiction (SF) from roughly 1900 until the present day, with particular attention on the late 1980s and contemporary SF short stories by Liu Cixin (刘慈欣). After discussing different definitions and theoretical concepts relating to SF, it examines the relationship between SF and three 'poles‘ of modern Chinese cultural production: the didactic, anti-didactic, and postsocialist.</abstract>

(1984), limited deformation was found in the form of shearing along bedding. Overall, the deformation was weak with low strain, though the degree of deformation varied throughout the study area. At two sites laminated bedding was well preserved and there was an original sedimentary magnetic fabric. This fabric had its maximum susceptibility at a low angle to the nearly vertical bedding plane, suggesting a sedimentary imbrication. All other sites with a structural foliation showed some degree of sedimentary magnetic fabric reorientation as a result of tectonic deformation. These sites show maximum susceptibilities of samples spread on the structural foliation plane. One site experienced greater deformation than others and the original sedimentary fabric is completely reoriented with maximum susceptibilities clustering as a weak lineation at ENE with a shallow plunge. Magnetic fabrics are consistent with bedding and foliation features seen in the field and can be used as a tool for structural analysis in locations where bedding or foliation cannot be clearly measured at an outcrop scale.</abstract>

        <abstract>Sea surface temperatures have been rising and are predicted to continue rising in coming years because of global warming. In addition, salinity has been decreasing in high latitudes and is expected to continue decreasing due to altered precipitation patterns and glacial melting caused by climate change. Many marine organisms that are adapted to the present conditions may be drastically affected by these oceanic changes. Early life stages will be especially susceptible, since they do not yet have fully developed adult defenses. In this study, we investigated the effects of reduced salinity (20 psu and 30 psu control) and altered temperature (15, 20, 25, and 29°C) on the growth, percent inorganic content (representing calcification), and feeding rates of juveniles and larvae of the invasive snail Crepidula fornicata. Both larval and juvenile growth rates were significantly depressed by low salinity and elevated by higher temperatures. The salinity that snails were exposed to as larvae significantly impacted juvenile growth rates in 4 out of 6 experiments, an example of latent effects, but the magnitude and direction of this effect depended on temperature and parentage. In addition, juvenile feeding rates were significantly depressed in low salinity but there was little change in percent inorganic content. Larval percent inorganic content at 20°C was 27% lower in 20 than in 30 psu. In conclusion, C. fornicata may experience more favorable conditions in a warmer future: growth rates will increase, probably making juveniles more resistant to predation. However, in regions where salinity is decreasing, C. fornicata juveniles will grow and feed more slowly, thereby increasing predation risk by forcing them to spend more time at more vulnerable smaller sizes. Thus, the future of C. fornicata and their potential to continue invading will depend on the specific salinity and temperature conditions they are exposed to during larval and juvenile development.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper focuses on the founding of Tufts College in 1852 by Christian Universalists. It is interested in how Christian Universalism transformed from a traditionally anti-institutional denomination to one interested in founding an elite liberal-arts college. In particular, it deals with how liberal humanist education served as a benchmark for elitism within the competitive religious market of the early 19th century.</abstract>

        <abstract>The current body of work on music and music listening’s effects on brain and behavior suggests that a subset of the population is susceptible to a music listening addiction. This paper provides a framework for music listening addiction (MLA) as a neurological, physiological, and behavioral affliction similar to recognized substance and behavioral addiction disorders. A comparative analysis of the neurochemistries of addiction and music listening indicates areas of overlap. These shared neurochemical activations should theoretically manifest themselves in similar behavioral symptoms. However, a standardized method of quantifying MLA behavioral symptoms does not yet exist. The Music Listening Addiction Symptoms Test (MLAST), a questionnaire utilizing a self-report method of testing, was distributed amongst a sample population. The MLAST found evidence for the presence of MLA within the population, but it proved to be a poor means of analyzing the effects of MLA. Nevertheless, MLA seems to pose little danger to the individual while music is accessible. Alternative studies of music listening are proposed, and the implications of MLA for the individual and for society are discussed. With few inherently harmful effects, MLA may be viewed as a positive addiction. However, while it is not indicative of risky behavior in most situations, MLA can be significantly harmful and destructive and must be taken seriously. Further neurological and behavioral research is necessary for the continued development of the MLA framework.</abstract>

        <abstract>DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ) is upregulated in many human cancers which is associated with a poor prognosis for these cancer patients. The D. melanogaster homologue of Pol θ is encoded by mus308 and contains two domains, an N-terminal helicase-like domain and a C-terminal polymerase domain, connected by a central, non-conserved linker region. Unlike human Pol θ mutants, which are extremely radiosensitive, D. melanogaster mus308 mutants demonstrate extreme sensitivity to interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents, such as nitrogen mustard (HN2), but are not radiosensitive. In order to investigate the domain-specific functions of Pol θ during ICL repair, we generated a host of Pol θ domain-specific mutants. Our HN2 sensitivity studies with ATPase-dead and polymerase-dead transgenic flies have demonstrated that the helicase-like domain of Pol θ is essential for the repair of HN2 induced ICLs while polymerase-dead flies were only moderately sensitive to ICL agents. Flies which express truncated Pol θ protein expressing part of the linker region and either only the N-terminus or C-terminus are equally extremely sensitive to HN2. These suggests that the C-terminus of Pol θ could have some function in recruitment of other proteins to ICLs outside of its catalytic function. It has been shown that the sensitivity to HN2 is partially rescued in flies which express the N- and C-termini of the protein in trans, suggesting that there is not an absolute requirement that the two catalytic domains be part of the same polypeptide. Our data support a model in which the helicase-like domain of Pol θ functions upstream of the polymerase domain and is crucial for repair of HN2 induced ICLs. Furthermore, we propose that the presence, but not the catalytic function, of the polymerase domain is also required for proper repair of ICLs.</abstract>

        <abstract>Previous studies have shown that musical training can improve cognitive processes. The purpose of the study was to investigate how long-term musical training affects visual and aural perception. This study was an expansion of the work by Patston, Corballis, Hogg, and Tippett, which found that musicians were more accurate on a line bisection task than non-musicians (2006). Twenty musicians and 20 non-musicians performed the same line bisection task with both hands, an audiospatial bisection task, and a pitch bisection task. We hypothesized that the musicians would be more accurate than the non-musicians on all three tasks. The results indicate that the musicians were not significantly better than non-musicians on the line bisection task, failing to replicate the previous research. However, an interaction was found between participant group and hand used. Musicians were about equally accurate with both hands, but non-musicians were more accurate with their right hands than with their left hands. Musicians and non-musicians were not significantly different on the audiospatial bisection task. Musicians were significantly more accurate than non-musicians on the pitch bisection task. More hours spent practicing per week, more years playing an instrument, and having relative pitch all correlated to smaller errors in the pitch bisection task. This suggests that musical training aids in processing pitch intervals. Future studies may examine if the Western musical scale influenced the musicians’ responses.</abstract>

        <abstract>Habitat fragmentation increases extinction risk by dividing populations into “islands” of smaller populations. By restricting movement across the landscape, habitat fragmentation can disrupt biological processes and threaten long-term population persistence. In the Hawaiian Islands, habitat loss and fragmentation have contributed to a high rate of avian species loss. Bird movement between wetlands is important for maintaining local populations. Habitat connectivity measures the ability of an animal in one habitat patch to reach other patches, and depends partly on “landscape resistance,” or the degree to which the landscape reduces the likelihood of movement between habitat patches. This study related observed inter-wetland movement patterns of Hawaiian stilts on Oahu to characteristics of the inter-wetland landscape in order to determine which characteristics impede bird movement. I hypothesized different levels of resistance for each of 4 landscape variables. I developed 4 models based on Euclidean distance and 108 models based on the 4 landscape features. For each hypothesis the landscape of Oahu was modeled as a GIS resistance surface. Each surface was evaluated to produce expected resistance distances between pairwise combinations of 10 wetlands on Oahu at which stilts were resighted. Expected resistance distances were compared to observed resistance distances derived from stilt resighting data. Elevation and landcover were the most influential landscape variables. Model explanatory power increased as the predicted resistance due to elevation increased. Both Euclidean distance and landscape variable models explained a significant amount of the variation in observed movement frequency among wetland pairs where movement was observed. Neither type of models predicted whether stilt movement occurred between wetlands. Occurrence or lack of movement may be influenced more by attributes of the wetlands themselves than by characteristics of the intervening landscape.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis is on a topic from the mathematics of machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. In sections 1 to 4, we consider extensions of the subspace clustering problem, which has lately inspired algorithmic developments applicable to computer vision, genomics, music analysis, and electroencephalography. This problem is simple to state: given multivariate data grouped along many low-dimensional subspaces, find the subspaces and the points’ memberships. Although some applications of subspace clustering algorithms involve data with matrix structure, recent algorithms disregard that, vectorizing data as part of the processing. We modify the subspace clustering problem using a construct from multilinear algebra, the tensor product of subspaces. This allows us to derive new algorithms that do not alter the original form of the data. We will argue that the new algorithms can carry out analysis more quickly and accurately than we could through subspace clustering. We mention applications where it may be possible to exploit this performance improvement. Our algorithms convert the multilinear subspace clustering problem into a graph clustering problem, where every point in a subspace is represented by a node on the graph and points are (ideally) connected if they belong to the same subspace. The algorithm we present to solve the modified subspace clustering problem is a randomized algorithm, and multiple trials are needed. Since every trial produces a new realization of the graph, we use sections 4 through 8 to consider various ways of combining graph realizations. We conduct tests on simulated data in order to evaluate them.</abstract>

        <abstract>How Big We Are is a documentary-style theatre piece featuring the voices of youth leading the movement towards a more just future for our nation’s immigrants. In an age when America’s youth are so often accused of apathy, mimicry and complacency, the undocumented youth movement, begun in the early 2000’s to fix the country’s broken immigration system and change a firmly established national discourse around migration and citizenship, is an important case of powerful youth agency and action. With deportations at all-time high levels, the growing militarization of immigration enforcement and the repeated failure of congress to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, Americans cannot continue to stand by as families are torn apart. With the aid of an accompanying classroom guide, How Big We Are can be performed and read in middle and high school classrooms to teach students about the contradictory and unjust realities of our country’s immigration policy, the ability of youths to make a real difference in their communities and the power of art as an organizing tool. It also raises important questions about the way to present discussions about race, documentation and immigration in the classroom. How Big We Are was created using a set of nine interviews conducted with activists, immigrant youth, politicians and citizens about their experience and views on immigration and immigration reform. The project built around it is an exploration in combining activist theatre and activist pedagogy with the goal of creating a curriculum capable of creating political consciousness in students.</abstract>

        <abstract>Understanding the mechanisms that coordinate cell migration, differentiation, and proliferation is a key goal in developmental biology. Alongside biochemical signals, it has recently been demonstrated that endogenous ion currents and voltage gradients play a role in determining cell fate. Here, we expand upon the knowledge by determining a role of biophysical events in cement gland formation. To investigate how biophysical events affect cement gland development in vivo, we overexpressed inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 to induce hyperpolarization. Characterizing the phenotype revealed an increase in ectopic expression patterns and abnormally shaped endogenous cement glands. A Ca2+ influx through voltage gated calcium channels may be responsible for transducing voltage potentials into changes in cell behavior during cement gland development. The results demonstrate a new role for transmembrane voltage potentials as a crucial upstream regulator in cement gland formation.</abstract>

        <abstract>Nearly 780 million people lack access to an improved water source and 1.5 million children under the age of five die each year due to diarrheal disease. Chlorinating water is one form of household water treatment that has been proven to be effective at disinfecting water; however, there is uncertainty in the ability of chlorine to effectively disinfect turbid waters. Turbid waters tend to have a larger chlorine demand, and particulate matter in turbid waters can shield microorganisms from disinfection. A double dose (3.75 mg/L) of chlorine is recommended in turbid waters. This research investigated the chlorine demand and microbiological disinfection of turbid waters with 10, 100 and 300 NTU and 0, 2, 10, and 25 mg/L of additional total organic carbon (TOC) when a double dose of chlorine was applied. Experiments were run in a laboratory using reactors with 10 L of RODI water, Kaolin clay to add turbidity, a TOC standard solution to add TOC, E. coli inoculated broth to add E. coli, and Clorox® bleach to add chlorine. Temperature, pH, TOC, free chlorine residual, total chlorine residual, turbidity, and E. coli were measured over a 24 hour period following chlorination. Four major conclusions were drawn from this research: (1) a double dose of chlorine was not large enough to maintain free chlorine residual levels as recommended by the CDC SWS program over a 24 hour period, (2) waters with higher TOC concentrations have a higher chlorine demand, (3) a double dose of chlorine effectively disinfected water of 10, 100, and 300 NTU with average log reductions between 6.4 and 8.2, and (4) a double dose of chlorine did not result in all water samples meeting the WHO drinking water standard of &lt;1 CFU/100mL when the initial concentration of E. coli was on the order of 10^8CFU/100mL.</abstract>

        <abstract>The radical right experienced a general resurgence across Western Europe in the past few decades, but in Hungary and Greece support recently swelled for parties even further to the right. In the last few years, Jobbik in Hungary and Golden Dawn in Greece have gone from fringe extremists with no electoral power to parties with seats in national and European parliaments. Though the rise of the radical right as a Europe-wide phenomenon was unexpected, the successes of Jobbik and Golden Dawn are especially surprising because these parties are much more extreme than other successful far right groups. Golden Dawn is anti-immigrant, Jobbik is anti- Roma, and both parties are anti-Semitic. They explicitly use symbols, language, and tactics that evoke the fascists of the 1930s and 1940s. These parties are growing and their success directly contradicts previous scholarship on the radical right. In this thesis I address the anomalous successes of Jobbik and Golden Dawn and present a new party family type called nationalist extremists. In addition to creating this party group, I formulate a theoretical framework to explain the factors that make nationalist extremist success a possibility. Finally, I present comprehensive reviews of Jobbik and Golden Dawn’s histories, ideologies, and activities in order to demonstrate their unique spots in the far right party pantheon.</abstract>

        <abstract>Colloidal quantum dots are an emerging class of nanomaterials beginning to be implemented into commercial displays. Companies such as Sony, QD Vision, and Apple are all currently researching quantum dot display technologies. Quantum dots are semiconducting nanoparticles that emit very saturated colors which make them ideal for displays. This research used colloidal quantum dots and a room temperature ionic liquid suspended in a polymer matrix (ionogel) to create a novel light emitting device architecture. The originally proposed mechanism for this device was to use the ionic liquid in the ionogel to create a large electric field around the quantum dots, causing the quantum dots to self-ionize and emit light. This new device architecture proved to be versatile, using both AC and DC biases. The peak wavelength of the electroluminescence was 612 nm and the emission spectra had a full width half peak of 30 nm; therefore, these devices emitted a saturated red color. The external quantum efficiency was calculated to be approximately 0.002%. These devices were operational in ambient conditions and were stable over a period of at least 3.5 hours. Because the devices were operational using a DC bias, the mechanism for electroluminescence could not be the originally proposed mechanism. Device functionality most likely involved a redox reaction with water vapor being one of the reactants. Future work should be performed to determine the reaction responsible for electroluminescence, and to improve the efficiency of light emission.</abstract>

        <abstract>The efficacy of a power assertive disciplinary style, in which the parent expresses his/her dominance over the child by employing tactics such as spanking, hitting, and/or removing a privilege, is still debated in the academic literature. This thesis uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to estimate the impact that a parent’s use of power assertive discipline has on his/her child’s academic achievement by grade eight. The estimates suggest that the effect that a power assertive disciplinary style has on academic achievement operates through two distinct channels: 1) it inhibits the child’s capacity to develop a strong internal locus of control, which translates into poorer academic achievement; and 2) it directly and negatively impacts educational success.</abstract>

        <abstract>Through a comprehensive analysis of David Hume’s political writings, this thesis examines Hume’s support of an established church on the basis of its political utility for maintaining the authority of civil government. Hume argues that government’s most essential function is to provide for the safety of its people, but that in order to do so it must first have authority sufficient to secure its own continued existence. Government’s authority rests not on force, but on the perceived self-interest and opinions of its people. Factions, which represent rival perceived interests and opinions, threaten government authority, and religious sects are among the most threatening factions of all. While many methods have been advocated to allay the detrimental political effects of religion, such as those of persecution and the institution of a separation of church and state, Hume suggests that only an established church can quell the flames of religious zeal and preserve government’s authority to rule.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper we present a risk detection system using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform to capture images, video, and radiation levels. Our approach produces real-time accurate detection of risk throughout the environment allowing the system to be used in real world rescue applications. We present low power radiation detection that enables the system to report accurate radiation levels with a minimal load on the UAV. The system can be used in other robotic platforms. It is highly modular and adaptable to other systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>Billions of people around the world today lack safe access to clean water sources and improved sanitation facilities. Many of these people also meet their daily water needs from surface waters that are susceptible to open defecation; thus, there is a great risk that these waters may be contaminated by waterborne pathogens. We have combined two well-established models: a pathogen fate and transport model and an epidemic model to predict the outbreak and progression of diseases caused by waterborne pathogens along an urbanized river channel. The fate and transport model predicts the transport and evolution of the pathogen in the river system, and the epidemic model predicts the outbreak of the disease once populations along the river have ingested that contaminated water. The communities then act as pseudo-incubators for the disease, effectively increasing the amount of pathogen in the river channel. A combined model provides a more holistic view of the waterborne infectious disease paradigm through the inclusion of a river and a human population component. We provide a case study for this model by examining the Cholera outbreak in Haiti in October 2010, and calibrating the model to the Artibonite River that runs through Haiti. This case study has provided confirmation of our model results to a certain extent. The model can serve as a decision support system to determine the best management practice and public health interventions, and also may be used to in guiding response to bioterrorism attacks. If used effectively, these hydroepidemiological models will lead to improved access to safe water and sanitation worldwide by serving as a tool to educate and guide decision making for water resource engineers and public health practitioners alike.</abstract>

        <abstract>This research explores the ways that urban healthy corner stores can improve food environments in low-income areas, counteracting the disparities in food access that contribute to rising U.S. rates of obesity and diet-related disease. Corner stores are often locally-owned businesses that are already equipped for food retail and are already frequented by neighborhood residents, making them more responsive to community preferences and more cost-effective than supermarket attraction strategies. Accordingly, cities and organizations are implementing “healthy corner store programs” to support the stores in selling healthy food, improving neighborhood livability and local business development. Based on a literature review and practitioner interviews, I assess the strengths and challenges of healthy corner store programs, review policy and planning tools to support these programs, and propose program evaluation methods to measure their outcomes. I find that most healthy corner store programs are still in initial phases, inviting innovation and expansion in coming years, which would be bolstered by more rigorous program evaluations. These initiatives can have most significant impacts as part of larger multi-pronged strategies to increase food access, and would be more institutionally sustainable if policy or planning approaches eventually replaced current resource-intensive programs.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Health Security Act has “the potential for transforming ethnic American communities into a 'new generation of substandard medical ghettos at worst and peripheral colonial outpost health subsystems at best.’ ” This is what Professor Vernellia Randall, Professor of law at the University of Dayton, wrote about Pres. Clinton’s effort for a healthcare reform. Exactly twenty years later, we have Pres. Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Obama administration promised that the ACA would give the United States a better healthcare system. What can marginalized communities truly expect from the reform? Will the reform rectify health inequities? Or will some communities continue to be served in ‘healthcare ghettos’? I use a four-component definition of health disparities to answer these questions. Healthcare disparities can be measured by the extent to which a person: has access to affordable care; receives superior quality or inadequate medical care; experiences discrimination; and can trust the care to be accessible and affordable on the long term. Drawing on research in public health, history, traditional economics and legal theory, I analyze the impact of the ACA on each of these measures of healthcare disparity. I conclude that the ACA only truly addresses the first of these four components, the affordability of healthcare. But it does so incompletely. I hope that this research will serve health and social justice activists to better describe their goals and strategize for future reform of the United States’ healthcare system.</abstract>

        <abstract>In his writing on political, legal, social and economic theory, one may find in the work of Friedrich Hayek one of the most comprehensive and unique justifications for liberal society in the last 250 years. This is largely a result of his use of spontaneous order theory. Hayek is clearly adamant in tracing the economic and political origins of that theoretical scaffolding to the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment. In doing so, he places Adam Smith in what he calls an ‘anti-constructivist’ tradition, actively working to dispel notions of rationally designed or mutually agreed-upon orders in the Hobbesian tradition in favor of analysis of spontaneous, unintended ordering forces. By tracing the ways in which Hayek draws upon Smithian thought, even in cases without explicit reference to Smith’s ideas as such, I argue that Hayek was justified in his placement of this Scottish moral philosopher and political economist in such a tradition; finding in Hayek’s work both a lucid understanding of Smithian ideas as well as effective argumentation for principled extensions of such a framework. Rather than simply appropriating and perverting Smith’s ideas through a libertarian bias, as some have argued, I endeavor to show that through his use of Adam Smith’s political economy and moral theory, Hayek strengthens and extends the spontaneous order tradition in pursuit of a more rigorous defense of what he calls the Great Society.</abstract>

        <abstract>The aim of this research is to incorporate the photo-reactive o-nitrobenzyl ester functional group into cationic polythiophene (PT) derivatives in poly(electrolyte)multilayer (PEM) films assembled using layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly. Integrating a photo-responsive moiety into the PT derivative allows for light to be used to disrupt the electrostatic interactions in the film, resulting in control over solubility of the film. The fabrication of these photo-responsive PT films is sought after in hopes of creating an organic semiconductor that is also a positive photoresist, meaning it is amenable to patterning using photochemical processes such as photolithography.</abstract>

        <abstract>It is often claimed that bilingual education policy preferences are a proxy for immigration policy references due to the fact that both policies have the same target population: immigrants. This thesis examines the intersection of immigration policies and language policies across three key modern time periods: 1986-1987, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In 1986-1987, the Immigration Reform and Control Act and the reauthorization of the Bilingual Education Act were signed. In 2001-2002, the DREAM Act was proposed, President Bush was conducting bilateral immigration talks with Mexican president Vicente Fox, the USA PATRIOT Act was passed, and the No Child Left Behind Act was signed. In 2005-2006, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act and the Inhofe Amendment to the act. This study codifies the rhetoric and framing of immigration and language policies in two major national newspapers, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The study establishes a new research design to examine how national printed media framed immigrants in articles covering immigration and language policy with either “universal” or “particular” claims. It applies this framework to test for similarities and differences in the characterization of immigrants in these articles and how that might affect the subsequent discourse. The study concludes that the two policy areas did not have rhetorical strategies that correlated over the three time periods due to the differences in the level of sophistication and nuance in the discourse. This analysis is a substantial expansion on the historical narrative of bilingual education policies.</abstract>

        <abstract>As technology continues to miniaturize processor chips, the thermal load of the electronics has become a primary hindrance in the development and implementation of more powerful chips. An internal effort by Draper Laboratory has been made in order to characterize the effect of their high density packaging method on the thermal load. The following thesis provides a thermal characterization of Draper Laboratory’s integrated Ultra-High Density (iUHD) material, an extreme miniaturization packaging method. The thesis covers the thermal effects of multiple layers of the iUHD material, the presence of metal traces, the isolation of the testing module’s components and the stacking of multiple modules. The thermal contribution of a layer of the iUHD material was determined to be 0.067-0.077 oC/W depending on the number of layers and the presence of metal traces. The thermal resistance contribution of the components of the second layer of the stack was determined to be 0.24 oC/W. The isolation of module components was successful and locally raised the temperature in the isolated areas by 4-5 times.</abstract>

        <abstract>Research has consistently demonstrated a memorial advantage for emotionally-salient information. It has been suggested that this enhanced recollection of emotional items leads to disruptions in the binding of peripheral information. Little is known however about how emotional states like anxiety may impact binding of emotional material, despite its practically important relevance to our understanding of binding disruptions in areas including flashbulb memory, eye witness testimony, and anxiety and mood disorders. We hypothesized that a state of anxiety would magnify the extent to which negative stimuli impact recognition of items (cues) and recollection of their context (targets). One hundred and three participants (18-26 years old, 52% female) were exposed to a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control version, after which they performed an associative binding memory task. This included an old/new recognition test of emotional cues and a cued recall test of their neutral counterparts. Heart rate, skin conductance level, and self-report data were additionally collected to index anxiety levels. Participants displayed enhanced recognition of negative cues, as well as disruptions in binding these cues with their neutral counterparts. However, results yielded no significant group difference of anxiety to have persisted during the memory task, indicating that the experimental manipulation did not have the desired effect. Future directions are discussed to elucidate causes of underlying memory performance.</abstract>

        <abstract> I performed this study under the supervision of Assistant Professor Babak Moaveni in order to complete the requirements for an undergraduate Senior Thesis at Tufts University. Vibration-based structural health monitoring can detect damage on a structure with the use of sensors and data acquisition systems. Previously at Tufts University, a research group implemented a wired sensing system on the Dowling Hall Footbridge to determine the dynamic parameters of the bridge. If the bridge’s dynamic parameters change, it indicates a change in the bridge’s structural properties, and therefore damage is detected. This research project focuses on the investigation of possible wireless sensing options for the same bridge. Sensors were compared based on specifications such as their sensitivities and noise floors. Once a sensor was chosen, it was evaluated on a shaker alongside different types of wired accelerometers. An error analysis was performed to quantify the variability of the measurements. Finally, the new wireless sensor was implemented on the Dowling Hall Footbridge to further evaluate the feasibility of an entire wireless array with it.</abstract>

        <abstract>Awarded High Honors, the 80-page thesis examines how and to what extent did the World Bank influence China's economic reforms since 1980. It details several specific social mechanisms by which the World Bank influences China's macroeconomic reforms at a policy level and internalization of international norms at a technical level. It concludes that the World Bank played a notable and indispensable facilitating role in China's transition from a planned to a market economy. The thesis lends further explanatory power to social constructivist approach to state behavior and provides key insights on how other developing countries should best engage the World Bank.</abstract>

        <abstract>No one can talk about Myanmar or Burma today without referring to unprecedented democratic, social and economic reform. Myanmar is at an historic stage in its development. Following adoption of a new Constitution in May 2008, parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and by-elections contested in April 2012. The transition to civilian rule under the new Constitution was the first step in an on-going series of rapid and far-reaching political and economic reforms. The country now faces the challenge of advancing the unification of multi-nations within the state, and establishing rule of law, access to justice, and political power redistribution while simultaneously maintaining economic stability and democratic values. This research paper will examine the ethnic conflict and self-determination of the Kachin ethnic group in the last fifty years and its future. The paper is structured into three broad sections. First, it deals with the Kachin’s group identity construction through a historical perspective during the pre and post-colonial period. Second, it explores ways in which international law and its traditional interpretation might respond to self-determination, minority rights and indigenous rights in Kachin’s context and how the peace process is being negotiated with the government. It also will explore the question why territorial autonomy and federalism is a hard question partly because it is all parties’ second choice positioning in the middle between the government unionist and the ethnic secessionist. Third, it draws challenges of their claims whether it is de jure and de facto feasible in political realities by examining the 2008 Myanmar constitution and its governance structures. It aims to explain why autonomy arrangement in paper alone is not a magic wand and does not necessary meaningful for justice and equality. Finally, the paper tries to come up with futuristic forecast and solution of the conflict in the last section.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this thesis, I have looked to two bodies of literature to reconstruct the identity of Kerver’s books of hours: scholarship on early print and on the Parisian printers, and scholarship on books of hours and their function. I have sought to bring these two together in my thesis, to gain a better and more complete picture of how Kerver’s printed books of hours functioned in context. My first two chapters address the scholarship on early print, and the characteristics used to evaluate the relationship between early print and manuscript. In a series of lectures delivered in 1960 and later published in a volume entitled, The Fifteenth Century Book: the scribes, the printers, the decorators, Curt Bühler first suggested that profound connections existed between early print and manuscript.11 Sandra Hindman, in an essay published in, Pen to Press: Illustrated Manuscripts and Printed Books in the First Century of Printing, expands on this narrative by exploring the incunabula’s fruitful experimentations with a mixture of print and hand-painted elements in illustration.12 Hindman suggests that early print and manuscript had fundamental similarities, of iconography, of illustration materials, and of format.13 These early studies frame my work on Kerver’s books of hours. They provided the grounds for an analysis of Kerver’s works which does not isolate his print production, but rather seeks to better understand Kerver’s printed hours by looking at their connections to manuscript production.</abstract>

        <abstract>Previous research has shown that attentional control and anxiety are related. For instance, people with higher levels of anxiety perform worse on attention-demanding tasks than healthy individuals, and these differences are also reflected in activated regions of the brain. The Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) theory divides attentional (also known as cognitive) control into two categories, proactive and reactive control. Research has shown that anxiety is associated more with reactive control than proactive control. Another line of research has shown that, using a validated set of instructions, people can be trained to use a specific cognitive control strategy. Reasoning that using reactive control might actually promote anxiety, the current study investigated whether training participants to use proactive control instead would have an anxiolytic effect. In the study, participants completed either a proactive or reactive cognitive training (random assignment) followed by a stress task, all while physiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance) along with self-report data on anxiety were collected. Results indicated that the proactive group exhibited marginally lower heart rate than the reactive group in response to social stress, suggesting a lower level of anxiety for the proactive group. Analysis of the skin conductance and self-report data showed no effect of the manipulation. Overall, it appears that cognitive control training may have an anxiolytic effect, but follow up research with more power is needed to amplify any marginally significant effects.</abstract>

        <abstract>The cult of Mithraism is one of many mystery cults within Roman imperial religious culture. However, what sets Mithraism apart, and makes it a special interest for scholarly study, is the lack of primary source accounts and textual documents of the cult liturgy, activity, and culture. While many aspects of the cult have been examined by scholars, the repast, an aspect of cult iconography and mythology as well as an actual activity, has received relatively little attention. This study argues that the meal is one of the central aspects of cult ritual activity and therefore that a study such as this one is necessary for better understanding the cult. In examining comparative meal culture, such as elite dining and religious feasts, as well as cult architecture and archaeological material, this study aims to not only define the role of the meal within the cult, but also highlight its importance to cult life and activity as well as looking at some of the specifics of frequency of occurrence and attendance.</abstract>

        <abstract>The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system and is composed of a cell body, dendrites, and a long axon. Neurons send and receive signals at synapses located at the terminus of axons and at various points throughout the dendritic arbor, and those signals are then transmitted through the dendrites and axons. Because most proteins are synthesized in the cell body, proper synaptic transmission requires the transport of hundreds of proteins and membrane bound vesicles from the cell body to the synapses and vice versa. Fluctuation in cellular activity requires continuous production and degradation of proteins, resulting in highly dynamic synaptic protein and vesicle concentrations. One example of a protein whose concentration is closely regulated at the synapse is the glutamate neurotransmitter receptor. This receptor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, processed in the Golgi complex, and transported from the cell body to be integrated into the synaptic plasma membrane. Conversely, once a receptor is targeted for degradation, it is internalized into endosomes, carried to multi-vesicular bodies, and ultimately degraded by lysosomes. Oftentimes, proteins and vesicles must travel large distances (up to one meter in humans) from the cell body to the synapses. Much remains to be learned about these processes, and in my project I focus on how organelles critical for synapse function are distributed and trafficked in neurons. I do so by examining the distribution of organelles involved in the glutamate receptor trafficking pathway and by identifying the role of the kinesin motor KLP-4 in trafficking these organelles.</abstract>

        <abstract>Psychiatrists have argued that Abraham Lincoln fits the modern diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. In 2012, two in three Americans said they would elect him today if given the option. Realistically, though, if a candidate had a history of a mental illness, would he or she be able to gain his or her party's nomination? Given the structure of the primary process and popular attitudes about mental illness, I argue that it would be difficult for a candidate with a history of depression to gain the nomination. If the leader to whom we compare so many candidates might not be able to survive the modern primary process, perhaps we should question whether we truly assess our options in a responsible and informed way.</abstract>

        <abstract>A novella-length piece of fiction. This story focuses on the journey of Coraline Connors, a teenager living in Lancaster, PA with her grandmother, as she travels to Cambridge, MA, the city in which she was conceived, in order to find out more about her origins. Coraline is also desperately searching for a community and a sense of belonging. The story is narrated by Coraline; the narration mixes elements of irreverent humor with a deep sadness and search for acceptance. This piece delves into themes of sexuality, gender, and religion. It also heavily employs musical references.</abstract>

        <abstract>This research traces the history of bilingual education policy in Massachusetts from 1965 to present, focusing on the town of Malden and its high school as a case study. In 1965, President Johnson’s progressive social reforms set a tone for developing bilingual education policy. Given the newly increased immigrant population and federal funding to schools, the era initiated political sympathy to students of Limited English Proficiency (LEP). For a quarter century, federal and state legislation facilitated programs that would support those students by developing their native languages alongside English. By the 1990s, opinions about how to teach LEP students had changed, matching a conservative turn in American social policy. New legislation banned native languages from schools in several states, including Massachusetts, thereby drastically shifting the way students learned. This thesis draws correlations between those pieces of legislation and broader American life. Changing socio-economic and socio-political climates in the United States shape the trajectory of bilingual education policy through its undulations since 1965. Overall, this thesis examines issues of immigration and national identity through a lens of bilingual education.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis is a comparative analysis of four novels written after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, each portraying the time period after the Spanish Civil War, known as the "Post-Guerra." These novels, written during the "Transition" to democracy in Spain, share the theme of attempting to give a voice to the victims of the Spanish Civil War and Franco's forty-year dictatorship. Additionally, each novelist uses the literary technique known as "metafiction" to recovery the repressed memories of this time period.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the wake of the 2011 famine in Somalia, humanitarian organizations across the globe began to call for a renewed focus on the concept of resilience. Though lacking a commonly agreed upon definition, resilience is generally understood to be the ability of an individual, household, or community to respond to shocks without succumbing to them over time. The 2011 famine and the late and inadequate response of the humanitarian community that followed has prompted many humanitarian actors to develop an organizational focus on building resilience to food security crises, especially in Somalia. This paper attempts to respond to the current demand for resilience-building interventions by developing a better understanding of what a successful food security resilience program in Somalia should and could look like. This paper begins with an indepth analysis of the concept of resilience and corresponding literature and policies, followed by an analysis of existing resilience programs being conducted in Somalia, before concluding with a recommended conceptual framework for building resilience in Somalia that incorporates the sectors and components that are critical in the design and implementation of food security resilience interventions specific to the Somali context. If resilience interventions are to be the future of food security programming in emergencies, their success will depend upon the effective incorporation of a wide variety of sectors into a holistic approach.</abstract>

        <abstract>United States’ foreign policy responses to the Sierra Leone civil war fluctuated dramatically over the eleven-year war. Policies ranged from logistical and financial support for multilateral and British interventions to humanitarian relief and culminated with the U. S. becoming the biggest financial supporter of post-conflict truth and reconciliation processes. A question remains, however, as to what national, geopolitical, and humanitarian factors influenced U.S. policymakers’ decisions. This study addresses media influence as a potential influence on U.S. responses to the war. Using the concept of the CNN effect, which suggests that media can determine foreign policy decisions under certain conditions, I complete an empirical analysis of the relationship between media and the U.S. policy decisions to support the creation of a U.N. peacekeeping mission and the mission’s later expansion during the height of the crisis in 1999 and 2000. The study expands the pool of literature on the CNN effect by providing among the first empirical analyses of the media-policy relationship in regards to the Sierra Leone civil war. For each decision, I consider media influence in relation to other factors relevant to U.S. policymaking, including U.S. national interests, the conflict’s timing, and the relationship of the U.S. to the U.N.</abstract>

        <abstract>Malaria remains one of the most devastating – but preventable and treatable – diseases, particularly in children under five. Nowhere is its effect more widely felt than in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 85% and 90% of all malaria cases and deaths occur, respectively. According to recent WHO estimates, there were roughly 660,000 deaths due to malaria in 2010, 85% of which occurred in children under the age of five. Africa has seen a modest reduction over-all in deaths in recent years, which has come at a price. Estimates placed the total global R&amp;D funding around US$600m in 2009, with an estimated US$2.3b available for prevention control. However, that $2.3b figure is less than half of the $5.1b estimated to be required to ensure universal access, and the figure of $600m in fact demonstrates under-attention of the present and impending concerns regarding treatment-resistant forms of malaria. Acknowledging the impressive yet sub-optimal global financial attention that malaria receives, this paper, submitted on World Malaria Day (April 25), will address these four topics, in an effort to give a comprehensive evaluation of the state of malaria treatment in sub-Saharan Africa: 1.	A history of antimalarial drug medication, with an evaluation of the pros and cons regarding access and cost of current therapies. 2.	A review of some creative solutions to overcoming intellectual-property rights and markets based incentives in a capitalistic economy that may not be naturally inclined to invest in antimalarial medications. 3.	The status of global funding for the cause of eradicating malaria, with predictions and expectations for what is needed to sustain and elevate R&amp;D funding over the next decade. 4.	How well that funding is being spent, by reviewing studies on cost-effectiveness and outlining a summary of recommendations on how to best utilize the limited financial resources to make the most economical health impact.</abstract>

        <abstract>Past research has generally asserted that women of color internalize and react more negatively to prejudice that is ethnically motivated than prejudice that is gender-based, but no one has examined whether this is true across contexts (King, 2003; Remedios et. al, 2012). Identity salience may act as moderator of the effect of rejection type (race or gender-based) on perceptions of prejudice by women of color. The goal of the current study is to examine whether identity salience affects the way Asian women attribute ambiguous, negative feedback which contains stereotypes applicable to both race and gender to racism or sexism. We predicted that Asian women will be more likely to perceive prejudice as sexist if their gender identity is salient, but more likely to attribute prejudice to racism if their racial identity is salient. The study design also answers the call for a more integrative perspective on the experience of minority women who face both sexism and racism, not always exclusively.</abstract>

        <abstract>Mast cells are critical in inflammatory processes through their release of pro-inflammatory mediators, including the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. The aim of this study was to characterize the release of these cytokines from HMC-1 human mast cells. Positive control stimulation of both of these mediators was established through the use of the calcium ionophore A23187 and PMA. It was shown that the neuropeptides neurotensin and substance P, for which mast cells have functional receptors, do not induce the release of these cytokines. The mechanism of release of these cytokines was subject to investigation, namely, whether these cytokines are pre-formed and stored in granules until their release, similarly to histamine, or whether they are synthesized de novo upon stimulation. This mechanism is currently unknown, but evidence from these experiments suggests that they are synthesized de novo, because peak cytokine release was observed more than 3 hours after stimulation. Further studies into intracellular cytokine mRNA levels and intracellular cytokine levels were attempted, and would be continued in the future. These studies would allow a more complete understanding of the release process and potentially offer support to the current theory that cytokines are synthesized de novo. The eventual implications of this research are far-reaching, as mast cells and these cytokines have been linked to various disorders including chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and tumorogenesis.</abstract>

        <abstract>The protein HBP1, a transcriptional repressor known to regulate Wnt signaling by preventing expression of Wnt target genes, has been found to be deleted or mutated in clinical invasive breast cancer samples, especially in triple-negative cancers which have increased Wnt signaling. Additionally, decreases in HBP1 have been associated with a shift in carbon metabolism, termed the Warburg effect, which is commonly found in cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that in addition to regulating Wnt signaling, changes in HBP1 levels may also be responsible for the altered carbon metabolism exhibited by cancer cells. Using MDA-MB-231 cells, a human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) line, we examined the biochemical effects of HBP1 overexpression through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Then, we performed further in vivo experiments using IS13 TNBC cells, in which we examined the efficacy of EGCG/Decitabine (DAC) treatment, a method known to induce HBP1. In both cases, in vivo experiments were performed by orthotopically implanting NOD/SCID mice with TNBC cells. We hypothesized that both HBP1 overexpression and EGCG/DAC treatment would result in reduction of Wnt signaling and Warburg effect enzymes in the treated tumors. The Western blot and qRT-PCR data for both experiments, along with 1H-NMR data for the EGCG/DAC experiments, indicate that both HBP1 overexpression and EGCG/DAC treatment result in metabolic shifts away from the Warburg effect, and that EGCG/DAC can directly suppress growth of TNBC tumors.</abstract>

        <abstract>Small modular reactors (SMR) represent the most recent innovation by nuclear engineering firms in the United States, and thus are the subject of a great deal of optimism within the industry. SMR units are advanced reactors (Generation III+ or IV) that are miniaturized to a capacity less than 300 megawatts, that also feature enhanced siting flexibility, improved safety, advanced instrumentation, longer refueling intervals, and a shift to factory production. Nuclear power in the United States has struggled with diseconomies of scale as well as socio-political opposition in recent years, so much so that only two new site builds have been initiated since 1979. SMR is being touted as the answer to the woes of nuclear power, though even the best laid plans of SMR proponents leave many questions unanswered. The process of innovation in energy technologies faces systemic challenges, and policy interventions are needed for nascent developments like SMR to allow it to test the rigors of the commercial market. A potential model for SMR innovation to emulate is the success of a closely-related but often overlooked technology with strong energy-related ties: nuclear attack submarines. Naval Reactors has found tremendous innovation success through tightly knit networks of public-private partnerships that encourages the flow of information, funding, expertise, and a powerful safety culture to all participants. Additionally, nuclear submarine innovation had struggled with cost escalations similar to nuclear energy until a series of policy mechanisms were employed to stabilize submarine economics. The findings of this study point toward a potential model for the Department of Energy and the domestic nuclear industry to emulate in order to support innovation in nuclear energy technologies like SMR.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents the results of an impact evaluation of BRAC’s Food for Training and Income Generation (FFTIG) program, which took place in South Sudan in 2008. BRAC’s original evaluation of the program found significant effects on girls’ educational enrollment as a result of the program. My analysis further explores the gendered effects of the program on educational outcomes. It also examines whether different social and economic characteristics of households caused some households to increase their investment in education over others.</abstract>

        <abstract> ‘Exceptionalism’ is a much used and often contested term in ongoing U.S. foreign policy debates. A central problem regarding American exceptionalism is the imprecision with which it is used, and its vague meaning in contemporary politics. Furthermore, the use of exceptionalism by policymakers across the political spectrum contributes not only to ambiguity surrounding the concept, but also to partisan purposes for specific party objectives. This thesis moves beyond the more political applications of exceptionalism in order to illuminate its origins, core principles, and evolution throughout American history. In so doing, this study seeks to shed light on the often-unarticulated role that exceptionalism and other ideals and beliefs play in the development of U.S. foreign policy. This paper also aims to provide clarity and depth to the study of exceptionalism by exploring the central theoretical frameworks behind the concept, as well as by using various case studies to highlight the practice of exceptionalism within American foreign policy. This research outlines key findings on the role of exceptionalism as an intervening variable within the foreign policy decision-making process. One such finding is that exceptionalism remains, as it has since the country’s founding, a central tenet of America’s liberal ideology and national identity. Moving forward, exceptionalism will continue to be subject to intense debate – at home and abroad. In order for American policymakers to pursue effective foreign policies that gain domestic and international support, they must be more self-aware of the national biases, ideals, and principles that influence the debate, in order to better articulate America’s diplomatic and military tactics and objectives in times of war and peace. Lastly, in the age of American hegemony – and the possible waning of that hegemony – questions of exceptionalism will only continue to become more relevant.</abstract>

        <abstract>The spread of exotic invasive species is an increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. Exotic invasives negatively impact community structure, although the degree to which they do this is poorly understood for recent introductions. It is therefore essential to elucidate the role that invaders play in new ecological communities. Ecological modeling can be used to form testable predictions of the impact of exotic invasives. The European paper wasp, Polistes dominulus, was first found in Eastern Massachusetts in the mid 1970s, and has since established populations across the United States. P. dominulus and its native congener, P. fuscatus, primarily rear brood on lepidopteran larvae, putting the two wasp species in competition and their shared prey species under increased predation pressure. We constructed an individual-based model of wasp foraging and nesting behavior to predict the impact of P. dominulus predation on lepidopteran prey populations. Our model uses location-specific weather data and local demographic data on P. dominulus nest growth, along with published data on foraging and nest building in Polistes wasps, to make targeted predictions of the number of lepidopteran larvae killed by individual P. dominulus nests in invaded communities. Fitting a linear regression model to our model output provided us with an equation that can be used to estimate the amount of caterpillar prey consumed by P. dominulus nests in Eastern Massachusetts. These predictions can be combined with information on P. dominulus nest density and prey preference to better identify how much prey is being consumed in a given area, and which prey species are most at risk from invasive wasp predation. Ultimately, our model serves as a foundation upon which we will continue to build a more generalizable model to predict the impact of paper wasp predation on community structure across the global range of Polistes.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper explores dynamics of attending and responding to affect as integral to, rather than separate from, attending to the substance of students’ ideas. I examine the relationship between responsiveness to affect and the disciplinary substance of student thinking. The questions I consider are: how does a teacher attend and respond to affect as integral to the substance of student reasoning and ideas in the science class? And how do these acts of attending and responding become consequential to student engagement? Using a case study of a fifth grade teacher's interactions with a student struggling to communicate an idea, I illustrate how the teacher’s attention and responsiveness to affect was an act of attending to the student’s reasoning and persistence. Moreover, I show how intending for his student to struggle at the intellectual level was an act of caring for him as an intellectual agent. In this way, I show how caring can be connected to and in service of student disciplinary engagement and epistemic agency. More broadly, I highlight the need to examine affect as inherent to the discipline in conversations on responsive teaching and I discuss implications on instruction and teacher education.</abstract>

        <abstract>A central issue of responsive teaching involves how teachers decide, tacitly or explicitly, to distribute their attention in the classroom. Even within the narrow realm of attending and responding to the substance of student thinking, teachers must constantly make decisions about what student thinking to pursue and how to pursue it. In this paper, we explore a third-grade teacher’s shift in the scope of her attention, from a wider consideration of the class’s sense of what they are doing—their epistemological framing—to a more narrow consideration of the conceptual substance of particular ideas. We claim that a key factor influencing the teacher’s scoping of attention is her sense of the stability of students’ framing.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper studies the ritual of Gājan or “hook-swinging”, a common practice in colonial Bengal. The ritual was a show of magical power gained by undertaking asceticism and worshipping the god Śiva; devotees showed the ability to swing unsupported from high poles. The British were disturbed by the ritual in the nineteenth century, and banned it in the 1860s. In this paper, I first study how a discourse on hook-swinging being a deviant low-caste practice was actively constructed by both British and the Indian urban middle class in the 1830s. Such discourses represented hook-swinging as a transgression of Hinduism. I finally show that a much more nuanced way to look at the ritual is to see it as what I call “temporary renunciation”. Small localised rituals like hook-swinging drew on and, in turn, influenced larger religious ideologies like renunciation and asceticism, and the householder-renouncer dichotomy. Recognizing that our understanding of many rituals has largely been through the colonial lens will help us develop more sophisticated understandings of the relationship of ritual, religious ideologies and colonialism.</abstract>

        <abstract>Beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, western European travelers began venturing to the Ottoman Empire on a more frequent basis. This increase in Oriental travel yielded a new collection of travel narratives. A topic of particular interest in the western travelogues was the Ottoman institution of the hammam, or bathhouse, and the ostensibly lewd behavior that took place within. Specifically, the behavior of Turkish females within the enclave of their all-female bathing quarters sparked the interest and imagination of early travelers. This study surveys the various references to Turkish female bathing culture within western European travel narratives from the mid sixteenth to mid eighteenth-century. It contends that the conjectural claims of female lesbian bathhouse activity made by early male writers reflected a strategic maneuver to reaffirm Christian values and to frame its adversary, Islam, as an amoral and illegitimate alternative; to assert western ethical and, consequentially, political superiority; and to expose domestic readers to a titillating and otherwise taboo subject matter while reinforcing their confidence in the propriety of their own sexual and cultural values and mores. Later reports on bathing culture by the British Ambassadress Lady Mary Wortley Montagu contradicted the earlier accounts, yet were equally deliberate. Montagu’s carefully crafted image of a modest and dignified female bathing scene fed into her broader idealized claims of Turkish female sovereignty, exposing an oft-overlooked strain of western gender insecurity and female malcontent. In both cases, the collective preoccupation with Turkish bathing ritual and sexual activity is emblematic of a western fascination with the alien and of a willingness to contort and exploit the foreign to satisfy domestically rooted demands for cultural reinforcement and political justification.</abstract>

        <abstract>This research paper, based on the quantitative analysis, explores the causal relationship between the South Korean government's multiculturalism policy and television news coverage. The focus is placed on (1) finding the association between television news coverage and the government’s multiculturalism policy-making process; (2) the portrayal of immigrants by television networks; and (3) evaluating South Korean media’s role in shaping the multiculturalism discourse based on generally accepted roles of the media. The paper also aims to filter out implications for further development of the government’s approach to the recent surge in the number of immigrants into the Korean territory.</abstract>

        <abstract>Nightmares, particularly those of the woman, form a consistently recurring theme and motif in Japanese female writings in the 11th century and from the 19th century onwards. However, the literary women’s nightmares expand beyond a momentary neurological phenomenon: they generally refer to situations of intense sufferings that a woman wishes to escape from, but is unable to. Their evolution in form and content reflects the changes in a woman’s relationships with her patriarchal society and, for some, her suppressed self; their propagation indicate her increasing awareness of her limited situation and her attempt to break out of it. Such a theme, if established and studied, can offer an alternative approach to understanding the social and psychological shift toward gender equality through a particular population that expressively advocates for it: women writers. However, current academic literature has yet to recognize such a phenomenon, at least not systematically. The purpose of this research paper is to establish the theme as an official literary tool among women writers within the specific context of Japanese literature. In this paper, I investigate six significant literary works by Japanese women, including one classic novel and one of its modern adaptations as well as four short stories, to prove that the theme is robust across time. I also offer some broad categorizations of nightmares, but the list is not exhaustive. This paper is based on a strong intuition, and should be considered a precursor paper to further research; the conclusion is open to criticisms and constructions. However, it is my hope to bring forward a potentially important literary device that embodies the interactions between a woman’s reality and her creative processes, which in this case produces not only literature but a social movement – a rebellion in effect.</abstract>

        <abstract>This thesis presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the myriad factors that shape our consumption, management, and views of these two iconic seafood species and why efforts to conserve them are facing increasingly divergent realities. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part I provides background on the current state of Atlantic bluefin tuna and how the fishery is managed domestically in the United States and internationally. Part II provides background on the current state of the world’s sharks, explores the history of shark fin consumption, and lastly examines how shark populations are managed domestically in the United States and internationally. Part III goes to the heart of the thesis as it explores the similarities and differences that exist between Atlantic bluefin tuna and sharks and how these factors are driving, or not, their respective conservation efforts. Part IV then returns to international conservation efforts by examining international fishery and wildlife treaties and regimes. Special attention is given to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or CITES, a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) that has been, in recent years, ground zero for the debate on how best to address the trade and need to conserve Atlantic bluefin tuna and highly threatened and endangered shark species. Finally, Part V looks to the future of Atlantic bluefin tuna and shark conservation. Possible advances and setbacks in both domestic and international policy arenas are examined. Part V concludes with recommendations for advancing conservation efforts of these two iconic marine predators.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper explores the impact of technology on dance technique, dancer safety, international dance collaboration, and choreography diversity, and proposes the implementation of dance technology into Fusion Dance Academy. Specifically, this research investigates quantitative movement analysis, motion modeling technology, and projective real time communication. Experiments and hypothetical situations surveying these applications show promising improvements to dance curriculums across the globe. We must embrace the persisting technological revolution, and open up to the possibilities it offers to dance education.</abstract>

        <abstract>According to the World Health Organization, malnutrition accounts for a staggering 45% of all deaths in children under the age of five. Malnutrition refers to any disorder brought on by improper diet; in developing countries, an improper diet is usually the result of a scarcity of food or a lack of certain nutrients. Although organizations like the United Nations have cited some success in addressing malnutrition, hunger remains one of the most urgent issues that the world must face. Studies show that the projected yields of major crops simply will not sustain the growing world population: “Global agricultural production may need to be increased by 60%-110%...to provide food security to the ~870 million now chronically undernourished” (Ray et al.). Genetically modified crops have the potential to considerably lessen the effects of malnutrition, as progress in the technology has already shown. Genetic modification offers the possibility of altering the nutritional value of any given crop with more precision than has been previously available to scientists. The technology also has the potential to respond directly to modern agriculture’s foremost problem by artificially increasing the yield of high-demand crops. The greatest difficulty with genetic engineering is the uncertainty of its peripheral effects. GMOs may be able to fight malnutrition, but they may also have detrimental effects on the environment, or unforeseen health consequences, to name just two of the possibilities. Thus, the successful implementation of genetic engineering to combat malnutrition will ultimately require major revisions and additions to the current policies regulating the agricultural industry.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes three different institutional experiences in developing research data management programs and services, challenges/opportunities and lessons learned.This paper is based on the Librarian Panel Discussion during the 4th Annual University of Massachusetts and New England Region e-Science Symposium. Librarians representing large public and private research universities presented an overview of service models developed at their respective organizations to bring support for data management and eScience to their communities. The approaches described include two library-based, integrated service models and one collaboratively-staffed, center-based service model.</abstract>

        <abstract>Germany has entered a new era since reunification and the end of the Cold War, and it continues to search internally as well as externally for its new place in Europe and the world. The events of the last five years in particular have made it clear that Germany will be expected to play a greater role in Europe, but is Germany capable and willing to be a leader in Europe and a world power? Germany’s new position of influence has been made possible by its economic power and its increased profile in Europe. Using its influence, Germany has led Europe by acting as a ‘patron state,’ committing resources to the task of leadership and shaping international institutions through a hegemony embedded in those institutions. But the Eurozone crisis has tested the limits of Germany’s patronage and, in isolating it, caused Germany to step back from a larger leadership role. German leadership has been prevented by its history, its normalization and emboldened pursuit of its national interests, its stretched economy and fear of debt, and a domestic existential crisis resulting in an inability to agree on its future. Germany is finding itself uncomfortable with being a patron without greater influence, but also with carrying the sole responsibility of leading Europe. Germany’s strength is built in large part upon its economy, and when it feels that is stretched, it is at risk of losing power and will be more likely to act in its own interests. The Eurozone crisis has seen Germany’s position soften as it caves to pressure from the other countries. Germany has too much invested in Europe to back away from its commitment to integration and working within the international institutions it has helped form, but it will seek burden sharing and leadership assistance in the future. Going forward, Germany will seek to share the burden of leadership and patronage, wishing to retain the project of integration, but not at the economic and reputational cost that it has recently sustained.</abstract>

        <abstract>The thesis provides a brief history of the rise of the Islamic terrorist organization al-Shabaab, analyzes its subsequent loss of support within Somalia, and then applies counterinsurgency theory to assess the chances of success of the international intervention currently underway in Somalia. It warns that state-building will be extraordinarily difficult in Somalia, and highlights a number of worrisome mistakes AMISOM and the Somali Federal Government have already committed. It ends by providing policy options for the United States and other involved countries, AMISOM, and the Somali Federal Government.</abstract>

        <abstract>For far too long, civilian non-combatants have borne the violent consequences of armed conflict and political repression. With the modern propensity for “wars amongst the people,” that trend has only continued, as civilian populations are repeatedly embroiled within – if not the direct targets of – violence and terror. And yet, despite profound experiences of harm, the suffering of victim-survivors – and of women and girls in particular – is all-too-often forgotten or rendered inconsequential in the period’s aftermath, with priority typically directed at broader reconciliation, development and institutional reform initiatives. My thesis seeks to contribute to a reformulation of this imbalance, shifting greater emphasis onto the repair of female victim-survivors – as their legal right, their due recognition, and an essential starting point in (re)building a peaceful society that values women and girls as equal citizens and rights holders. To that end, I outline key elements and methodological approaches of a gender-just reparations program – illuminated by recent successes and failures – striving for both conceptual depth as well as practical guidance in the design and implementation of reparations programming.</abstract>

        <abstract>The purpose of this thesis is to explore the challenges of public participation in China’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) process and identify opportunities for improvement. The analysis draws from both current literature and in-depth interviews. It reveals that procedural, technical, attitudinal and structural challenges limit the effectiveness of public participation in EIA. These include a lack of clear definition of the public and how to conduct participation processes, lack of education and training among stakeholders, lack of trust between local government and the public, perverse incentives and conflicts of interest, and weak monitoring and enforcement by local government. Changes should be made to address the procedural gaps and resources should be dedicated to conduct research and educate stakeholders. With worsening environmental degradation, rapid urbanization and an increase in citizen protests on environmental issues, public participation in EIA has the potential to integrate citizen concern into decision-making and support local environmental governance in China.</abstract>
