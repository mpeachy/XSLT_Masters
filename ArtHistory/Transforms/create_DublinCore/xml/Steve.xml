        <Description>Description: This wine vessel was found in the tomb of Fu Hao, the consort of Wu Ding (the 23rd Emperor of the Shang Dynasty). The earliest Chinese bronzes were made by the method known as piece-mold casting—as opposed to the lost-wax method, which was used in all other Bronze Age cultures. In piece-mold casting, a model is made of the object to be cast, and a clay mold taken of the model. The mold is then cut in sections to release the model, and the sections are reassembled after firing to form the mold for casting. If the object to be cast is a vessel, a core has to be placed inside the mold to provide the vessel’s cavity. | Location created: Henan Sheng, China | Date created: c.1300-1030 BCE | Medium:  Bronze  | Measurements: h. 66.8 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: This wine vessel (zun or tsun) was found in the tomb of Fu Hao, the consort of Wu Ding (the 23rd Emperor of the Shang Dynasty). The vessel is inscribed with her name. Used in religious ceremonies to hold wine, the vessel has a wide lip to facilitate pouring. The owl-like creature stands on two legs; a down-turned tail forms the third leg. The back of the head is a removable lid with a miniature bird and dragons as knobs. | Location created: Henan Sheng, China | Date created:  c.1300-1030 BCE | Current location: Institute of Archeology, Beijing | Medium:  Bronze  | Measurements: h. 45.9 cm

        <Description>Description: This tiger-shaped bronze with deep cavities is extremely heavy and must have been made as supports for an unknown purpose, perhaps to raise a group of musical instruments or a special piece of furniture. Whatever the intended function, the form was obviously inspired by real tigers. The low-slung body is elongated, with powerful legs and a long, coiled tail. Its blocky, ferocious head has erect ears and dots that represent whisker follicles. The flank, lower legs, and tail are covered with stripes to evoke the patterns on the live animal. On second look, however, the stiff forms are boxy and abstract, hovering between natural and decorative impulses. Signaling an early phase in Chinese representational sculpture, the three-dimensional image was approached as an assemblage of flat views of sides, front, back, and top. According to a note received when these objects were acquired in 1935 by the Freer Galleries, objects such as this were unearthed in 1923 at Baoji in Shaanxi province in the hereditary homeland of the Zhou dynasty rulers. | Date created: c.900-850 BCE | Current location: Freer Gallery of Art | Medium:  Bronze  | Measurements: l. 75.2 cmm h, 25.2 cm

        <Description>Description: Despite its asymmetric pose, this figure achives a dynamic equilibrium in its stance that is appropriate to an acrobat. The tension of balancing is conveyed through the flexed arms and legs. The figure's costume is minutely observed. The man wears a short robe secured around the waist by a belt from which hangs a dagger.The fact that he wears trousers and boots, items of dress first introduced into China around the fifth century BC, may mean that he representss a northern nomad rather than a Han chinese. | Date created: 5th-4th c.

The Terracotta Army or the "Terracotta Warriors and Horses" is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210-209 BCE and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers (such as this soldier shown), 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits nearby Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. | Location created: The masoleum of Emperor Shihuangdi, Lintong, Shaanxi Sheng (China) | Date created: c. 210 BCE ) | Medium: Terracotta earthenware  | Measurements: 70 in

Cave 6 is classified as part of the Middle Period of the Yungang Grottoes, and characterized by its more complex carvings. Buddha makes the fearlessness hand gesture, or abhaya mudra. A mandorla (an almond shaped halo extending around his body) indicates his divinity. The flames suggest the Buddha's radiating energy and tiny images of the Buddha recall the miracle at Shravasti, in which Shakyamuni appeared to replicate his body 1000 times in order to illustrate the principle that existence is only an illusion.  | Location created: Datong, Shanxi province, China | Date created: c. 471-499 CE | Current location: Datong, Shanxi province, China | Medium:  Sandstone with pigment</Description>

        <Description>Description: This mandala represents Amida Buddha's Western Paradise or Pure Land, where the souls of fervent believers are reborn to continue their quest for spiritual enlightenment free from the difficulties associated with life on earth. In the center, Amida sits beneath a jeweled canopy surrounded by a host of other deities and worshippers. His splendid palaces are in the background and the sky is filled with flying deities and heavenly musicians. The palaces are based on eighth-century Chinese palaces. Amida faces a pond where the souls of the deceased are reborn on lotus blossoms. According to tradition, the first Japanese mandala of Amida's paradise was painted in the eighth century and has been preserved in the collection of Taima-dera temple near Nara. As worship of Amida became increasingly popular in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, numerous copies were produced. Accordingly, this painting and others like it are referred to as Taima Mandala. | Location created: Japan | Date created: c. 14th century CE | Current location: The Minnesota Insitute of Arts | Medium:  Ink, color, gold, and cut gold leaf (kirikane) on silk | Measurements: 50.5 x 46 in</Description>

As a bodhisattva, Guanyin has forgone Buddhahood to help other sentient beings be free of suffering before enlightenment. In this sculpture of the Guanyin bodhisattva, we see the figure adorned with elaborate necklaces, signaling royality, and standing atop the double lotus, symbolizing purity.  | Location created: China | Date created: c. 580 CE | Current location: Boston Museum of Fine Arts | Medium: Limestone with traces of polychrome and gilding | Measurements: 249 x 71 x 71 cm (98 1/16 x 27 15/16 x 27 15/16 in)</Description>

        <Description>Description: Though this is a detail of a single scene, the format of this painting is a handscroll-- a horizontally organized composition on paper or silk, designed to be gradually unrolled and viewed from right to left. This scroll is a visualization of Zhang Hua's (232-300) poem of the same title. The images, such as this detail, teach the proper behavior of imperial consorts and concubines. Images, such as this, represent both historical figures and idealized scenes that demonstrate the importance of virtue, cultivation of character, trust, and family. This particular scene shows the emporer turning away from his consort, his hand raised in a gesture of rejection. | Location created: China | Date created: c. 5th - 8th century CE | Current location: British Museum, London | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on silk  | Measurements: 9 5/8 x 135 3/5 in (24.3 x 343.7 cm)</Description>

The the right, another lady (facing away from the viewer) looking into a mirror held in her hand. The two mirrors in this scene perhaps indicate reflections of the figures' inner nature as much as their external appearence. | Location created: China | Date created: c. 5th - 8th century CE | Current location: British Museum, London | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on silk  | Measurements: 9 5/8 x 135 3/5 in (24.3 x 343.7 cm)</Description>

        <Description>Description: Landscape emerged as a dominent genre in Chinese painting, and the painters of the Southern Tang and Northern Song dynasties that specialized in it would retrospectively be heralded as the originators of pictorial styles that later artists employed. Landscape paintings, such as this by Dong Yuan, indicate both natural observation and stylistic exaggeration in the created composition. This landscape painting specifically shows the rounded mountains of Jiangnan, the region of China south of the Yangzi River that formed the domain of the Southern Tang state. | Date created: c. 950 CE | Medium:  Hanging scroll, ink and color on silk  | Measurements: 156 x 160 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: This large hanging scroll is Fan Kuan's best known work and a seminal painting of the Northern Song school. It establishes an ideal in monumental landscape painting to which later painters were to return time and again for inspiration. The painting's style also includes conventions dating back to the Tang Dynasty. The classic Chinese perspective of three planes is evident - near, middle (represented by water and mist), and far. However, unlike earlier examples of Chinese landscape art, the grandeur of nature is the main theme, rather than merely providing a backdrop. | Current location: National Palace Museum, Taipei | Medium:  Ink and color on silk  | Measurements: 81.22 x 40. 67 in</Description>

        <Description>Description: A masterpiece of the Northern Song monumental landscape painting tradition, Early Spring is a rare example of an early painting executed by a court professional who signed and dated his work.  The work demonstrates Guo Xi's innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives, which he called "the angle of totality." The brushwork registers infinite variations of pressure and ink; the silhouette of the rocks and boulders are delineated with a heavy touch, the foggy trees with a light one. The artist also shows a concern with the idea of 'temporarily,' evident in the representation of the eroding landscape and specific seasonal moment. | Location created: National Palace Museum, Taipei | Date created: 1072 CE | Medium: Ink and color on silk  | Measurements: 158.3 x 108.1 cm </Description>

        <Description>Description: The son of Mi Fu (1052–1107), Mi Youren was an accomplished scholar-artist, calligrapher, and the leading connoisseur of his time, often acting as the authenticator of ancient paintings for the emperor. He rose to the position of vice president of the Board of War. The simplified, blurry mountain forms, which Mi Youren inherited from his father (there is no longer any reliable example of the older Mi's painted work), represent a significant break from the detailed Northern Song landscape styles. Created with wet ink dots (called "Mi-family style") this style of landscape painting is the immediated predecessor of the evocative ink-wash landscape style of the later Southern Song period. Referred to by scholar-artists as "ink play," the style suggests the importance of the painter's psychological expression, thereby raising the status of painting to that of poetry and calligraphy. Mi Youren was an important figure in Southern  Song literati painting. | Date created: 1130 CE | Current location: The Cleveland Museum of Art | Medium:  Handscroll, ink and color on silk  | Measurements: Image: 43.70 x 192.60 cm (17 3/16 x 75 13/16 inches); Overall: 45.50 x 646.80 cm (17 7/8 x 254 5/8 inches)</Description>

        <Description>Description: Court painter Ma Yuan, a fourth-generation member of a family of painters, was a leading artist at the Southern Song painting academy in Hangzhou. Along with Xia Gui, Ma Yuan originated the Ma-Xia style of landscape painting. In this album leaf, which shows a gentleman in a gardenlike setting, the jagged rhythms of the pine tree and garden contrast with the quiet mood of the scholar, who gazes pensively into the bubbling rapids of the cascade. This image demonstrates one-corner composition, heavily weighted toward the bottom left.  It also shows a sense of atmosphere through ink wash, particularly noticable in the silhouette of the distant waterfall.  | Location created: Hangzhou, China | Date created: c. late-12th - early-13th centuries | Current location: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | Medium:  Album leaf; ink and colors on silk  | Measurements: 9 7/8 x 10 1/4 in.

        <Description>Description: Xia Gui was part of the Ma-Xia School of landscape painting. 'Twelve Views of Landscape' once included 12 scenes, but only the last four survive on Xia's original scroll. An empress's single-dragon seal appears in red below each of the titles, suggesting that the calligrapher could be Empress Yang Meizi. The titles of each scene allude to poetry on the 'Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang Rivers,' a theme concerning withdrawl of society that originated with the Northern Song literati. The painting includes motifs familiar from the associated pictorial tradition.
