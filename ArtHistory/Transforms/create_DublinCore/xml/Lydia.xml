        <Description>Description: This oval bowl is a fine example of the kind of silverware that entered the Sasanian repertoire in the early 6th century. One of the common motifs decorating a drinking bowl is the inhabited vine, as seen here. | Location created: Iran (?) | Date created: 6th-7th century | Current location: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States | Medium: Silver, mercury gilding, hammered, repousse, chased, gilded | Measurements: 7 x 11.1 x 23.3 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: This type of ewer, derived ultimately from a Roman-Byzantine shape, does not appear in Sasanian silverware before the 6th century. The lavish decoration consists of four female figures in a dancing pose dressed in diaphanous clothing, each holding two objects. They stand in arches formed of rosettes that are supported by pilasters decorated with spiraling vine. | Location created: Iran (?) | Date created: 6th-7th century | Current location: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States | Medium:  Silver, embossed, punched, repousse, chased, gilded | Measurements: H. 34.2 cm, Max. diameter 13.3 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: The church of the Red Monastery (Dayr Anba Bishay) is a basilica with a long nave, terminating in an elaborate tri-lobed sanctuary. Each of the three half circles that form the trefoil sanctuary consists of two ornamented tiers topped by a semi-dome. Depictions of Christ, the Virgin Mary, apostles, evangelists, prophets, and angels create a complex series of messages about salvation. The addition of monastic saints connects the paintings to the setting of the monastery. The numerous and brightly colored designs on the architectural sculpture are the best surviving example of what were Classical and Egyptian traditions that continued into Late Antiquity. | Location created: Sohag, Egypt | Date created: 500-525</Description>

        <Description>Description: This carving has an uncommonly high degree of three-dimensionality, most pronounced in the central figures. It is likely that the object was intended to function as an applique, but whether to decorate a piece of furniture or an interior architectural space is open to question. The central figure is believed to possibly be St. Mark, surrounded by his 35 successor Coptic patriarchs of Alexandria. | Location created: Syria of Egypt (Alexandria) | Date created: 7th century | Current location: Musée du Louvre, Paris, France | Medium: Ivory | Measurements: 15 x 12 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: These well-wrought liturgical objects—chalices, censers, a strainer, and a representation of the dove of the Holy Spirit—were among the possessions of a Christian church in the affluent merchant town of Attarouthi in Syria, then one of the richest lands of the Byzantine Empire.  The chalices, censers, and strainer were used for the Divine Liturgy, or Eucharist service, in which Christians take consecrated wine and bread in commemoration of the Last Supper and Christ's death.  In the early seventh century, Syria fell first to the Sasanian Persians and then to the armies of Islam. These works were probably buried in haste in a protective container at some moment when the Byzantine army was retreating from attacks on the region. | Location created: Attarouthi, Syria | Date created: 500–650 | Current location: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York | Medium: Silver, silver-gilt  </Description>
