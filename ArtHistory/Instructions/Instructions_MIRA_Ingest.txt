Process for ingesting Art History images and associated metadata into MIRA for display in Trove

First you must determine whether it is a collated batch that you are ingesting (several catalogers sent you their small batch of a larger Excel sheet), or if a single cataloger sent you a single Excel sheet.
Excel files and xml should stay in the apropriate folders, which are found on the shared Art History drive, i.e.:

Transforms/collatedBatches...
Transforms/singleBatch...

Also, Art and Art History students occasionally change the field names in the Excel sheet.  If this has occured, a copy of the existing names is avilable in the 'Instructions' folder.  Just copy and paste.
Then you can move your Excel file(s) to the apropriate folder, and work through the next steps:

1.	From oXygen, select File/Import/Ms Excel Files:

2.	Navigate to the Excel file that needs to be imported.  Make sure it is an Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls)

3.	Open it, and select:
                a.	Next -->

4.	In Import criteria select: 
		a.	First row contains field names
		b.	Open in Editor

5.	In your new xml, clean up the students use of the pipe either individually if this is a single batch ingest, or by using Find/Replace in Files if you are working with a number of files
		a.	 Select Find/Replace: 
			i.	Select Regular expression and enter in Text to find:
			ii.	(\s\|\s)|(\|)|(\s\|)|(\|\s)
			iii.	Replace with:|

6.	Save this file as TransformThis_ChXX.xml if a single ingest, or by each cataloger's first name if a batch ingest, i.e. 'Alex.xml'

7.	Open ArtRunThisSingleBatch.xslt or ART_RunThisForCollatedBatches.xslt as apropriate

8.      Associate your input xml and your output xml (Wrench button)
                a. Select your xslt (if there is no xslt, you will make a new one, and then follow from b), and select edit.
                b. From xslt tab, browse (folder) to your xml. NOTE: if this is for a collated batch, you need to associate it with the 'collection.xml' file
                c. From output tab, browse (folder) to where you want to save your new xml

9.	Select Apply transformation scenario (Play button)

10.	Save your new xml as IngestThis.xml

11.     In your new xml, clean up issues by limiting a regex to an xpath, for instance, look for use of possesives in a title
                a. Select Find/Replace:
                        i. Select Regular expression and in Text to find:
                        ii. '\w
                        iii. In the xpath field enter: /input/digitalObject/*[namespace-uri()='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/' and local-name()='title'] | /input/digitalObject/*[namespace-uri()='http://purl.org/dc/terms/' and local-name()='alternative']
                             This limits your search to the title and alternative title fields
                        iv. Make changes to any possesive that seems off

12.	Review xml for other preprossing errors, and then from MIRA start a Batch XML ingest.
		a.	Select IngestThis.xml and then select Next
		b.	Associate requested images
		c.	Review batch status
