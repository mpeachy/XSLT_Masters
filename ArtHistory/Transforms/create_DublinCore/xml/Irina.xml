        <Description>Description: According to the inscription on the base of the Bodhisattva of Friar Bala, the image was a gift of that friar and was executed just before or just after 100 CE. The inscription states that the figure is a Bodhisattave but for all artistic and stylistic purposes, it is a Buddha image, one of the first to depart from strictly aniconic symbolism and to render the master in a human form. The figure originally stood before a tall column which supported both the image and a large parasol over it, curved with the signs of the zodiac. At the foot of the statue is a lion representing the image of the Buddha as a lion among men and referring to his royal origin. There is still a very geometric character to the technique used on the Bodhisattva image that is characteristic of early Buddha figures. Emphasis has been placed on linear patterning of drapery and on abstract bodily features, especially the face. Overall, the form is massive and gives a profound monumentality to the Buddha image.| Location created: Sarnath| Date created: c. 100 CE | Current location: X | Medium: Red sandstone | Measurements: Height 113.9768 in</Description>

The columns, which are decorated with floral patterns and pearl swags, define the path for the traditional circumambulation of the stupa at the rear of the room.

        <Description>Description: This torso of Buddha, carved into the red sandstone typical of the Mathura region, epitomizes the style of the workshops  in the Gupta period. Represented standing in a frontal and perfectly symmetrical pose, this figure is carved in very high relief on a single large slab of red sandstone. This work, now headless, has a particularly sensitive modeling and is characterized by classical influences -- his broad muscles, shoulders, and narrow hips, his powerful arms, and long legs appear under the drapery.  The missing right hand was originally to sketch the gesture of fearlessness "Abhaya mudra." The head of the Buddha was once framed by a large circular ring, decorated with floral motifs and beads on a background lush foliage. Purity of form, harmony of proportions, the workmanship of the bust and the sensitive treatment of the dress and the halo, make this figure the archetype of Buddhist sculpture, and influenced later Buddhist sculpture in South-East Asia, Tibet, China and Japan. | Location created: Mathura, India | Date created: c. 5th century CE | Current location: Musee Guimet, Paris | Medium: Red sandstone | Measurements: Height 142 cm</Description>
