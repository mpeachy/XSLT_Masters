Each of the three half circles that form the trefoil sanctuary consists of two ornamented tiers topped by a semi-dome. Depictions of Christ, the Virgin Mary, apostles, evangelists, prophets, and angels create a complex series of messages about salvation. The addition of monastic saints connects the paintings to the setting of the monastery. The numerous and brightly colored designs on the architectural sculpture are the best surviving example of what were Classical and Egyptian traditions that continued into Late Antiquity.|Location created: Sohag, Egypt.|Date created: 500-525.|Accession Number: 16.8535-22**	**Byzantium and Islam**	**0525**	**Image**	**image/tiff**	**Coptic church buildings--Egypt.|Coptic art--Egypt.|Architecture, Byzantine--Egypt.|Apostles in art.|Church decoration and ornament.**	**Mary, Blessed Virgin, Saint--Art.|Jesus Christ--Art.**	****	****	**Late Antique.|frescoes.|Coptic (Orthodox Christianity)|Early Byzantine.**	**6th century.**	******draft:17869**	**Tusk Fragment with Apostle on Throne, Surrounded by Followers in Front of a City.**	****	****	****	**This carving has an uncommonly high degree of three-dimensionality, most pronounced in the central figures.
