        <Description>Description: Champaigne's portrait of his daughter Sister Catherine de Sainte Suzanne and Mother-Superior Agnès Arnauld is a votive offering depicting a miracle involving his daughter's illness. The story claimed that after the young paralyzed Catherine was visited by Agnès, Catherine suddenly regained her health and became increasingly mobile. This portrait depicts Agnès's visit, with the miracle referenced in the light that casts down between the figures. Unlike Champaigne's other painting, the figures have a sculptural quality, isolated from one another.| Date Created: 1662| Current Location: Musée du Louvre, Paris| Historical Period: Baroque| Measurements: 164.8 x 228.9 cm| Medium: Oil on canvas</Description>

        <Description>Description: This history painting depicts General Germanicus's death after having been poisoned by Tiberius, the Roman emperor and the general's jealous adoptive father. Poussin's version of the story shows a stoic Germanicus with a grey pallor laying on his deathbed, with mourners surrounding him. Even though the hero is suffering, he still appears dignified, which communicates the injustice of the story. Poussin arranges this scene using a shallow spatial configuration which he adapts from reliefs on ancient Roman sarcophagi.| Date Created: 1627| Current Location: Minneapolis Institute of Art| Historical Period: Baroque| Measurements: 147.96 x 198.12 cm| Medium: Oil on canvas</Description>

        <Description>Description: The title of this painting translates into "Even in Arcadia, I exist," which refers to the presence of death, even in utopian paradise. Thus, this painting, which depicts several Arcadian shepherds who have stumbled upon a tomb, is a memento mori, reminding the viewer that death awaits everyone. The painting is set in an idyllic landscape and the composition is focused tightly on the four shepherds who soberly examine the inscription on the austere tomb.  | Date Created: 1637-1638| Current Location: Louvre Museum, Paris| Historical Period: Baroque| Measurements: 87 x 120 cm| Medium: Oil on canvas</Description>

        <Description>Description: Commissioned for the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna, Reni's painting depicts the biblical episode of the "Massacre of the Innocents," in which Herod the Great (the Roman-appointed King of the Jews) ordered infanticide for all male children in order to prevent the birth of a newborn king. This painting depicts the horror and chaos of the massacre, with a soldier pulling on the hair of a mother and slaughtered babies on the floor.

David models Goliath's head, which rests on a pedestal and shows the forehead wound from the young hero's slingshot. David's pale skin and brilliantly colored garb stand out in contrast to the painting's tenebrist background. | Date Created: c. 1604-1606| Current Location: Louvre Museum, Paris| Historical Period: Baroque| Measurements: 2.37 x 1.37 m| Medium: Oil on canvas</Description>

        <Description>Description: Velázquez's painting of María Teresa, the daughter of King Philip IV of Spain, shows the young Infanta wearing an elaborate wig decorated with ribbons and a large white gown embroidered with pearls. Although the elder Hapsburgs were traditionally portrayed in black, the princess has a youthful and bright appearance in her luxurious garments. The pocket watches attached to her dress connote the seriousness of her role. | Date Created: 1651-1653 | Location Created: Madrid, Spain| Current Location: Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna| Historical Period: Baroque| Measurements: 127 x 98.5 cm| Medium: Oil on canvas</Description>
