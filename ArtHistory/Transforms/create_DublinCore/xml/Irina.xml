        <Description>Description: The original use and arrangement of these fourteen ivories of the So-called Grado Chair with scenes from the life of Christ, depictions of saints, and of Saint Mark as first bishop of Alexandria remain uncertain. They may have been part of a liturgical throne given by Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–41) to Grado, Italy, after his successful re-conquest of Egypt. On this panel, Saint Peter (left), inspired by an angel, dictates his teachings to Saint Mark (right) in Rome. Saint Mark diligently records Saint Peter’s words in a pose traditional for a scribe.  | Location created: Alexandria, Egypt (or Constantinople, carved)| Date created: ca. 630-640 (carved) | Current location: Victoria and Albert Museum, London | Medium:  Ivory  | Measurements: Height: 13.5 cm, Width: 10 cm at top, Depth: 0.8 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: Three Hebrew youths stand unfazed among the flames to which they were condemned for refusing to worship idols. Because they survived, these Old Testament figures were considered models for Christian martyrs.

        <Description>Description: Prominent in this icon is the near nudity of Christ: a sheer loincloth allows most of his body to be seen.

        <Description>Description: This icon represents the story of a contemporary of Christ, King Abgar of Edessa, who sent Ananias to paint a portrait of Christ, but he could not. Instead, Christ imprinted his features on a cloth (the Mandylion).
