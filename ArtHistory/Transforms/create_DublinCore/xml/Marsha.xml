        <Description>Description: This image is a detail of the 'Birds and flowers of the four seasons' fusuma at Juko-in in Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto, Japan. These particular fusuma, painted by Kano Eitoku, illustrates a style that combines the Muromachi ink-painting tradition with the brightly colored and decorative yamato-e style, developed during the Heian period. The plum tree is a symbol of spring. From the lineage of professional artists known as the Kano School, Eitoku's vigorous use of brush and ink, his jagged outlines, and dramatic compositions recall the style of Sesshu, but the bold new sense of scale in his works is a defining characteristic of the Momoyama period. | Location created: Kyoto, Japan | Date created: c. 1563-1573 CE | Current location: Jukoin, Daitokuji in Kyoto, Japan | Medium: Fusuma (sliding screen) with ink and color on paper | Measurements: Height 69.13 in</Description>

        <Description>Description: Himeji Castle has been given the name White Heron. To reach the upper fortress, visitors must follow angular paths beneath steep walls, climbing from one area to the next past stone ramparts and through narrow fortified gates while feeling as though lost in a maze with no sense of direction or progress.  A climb up narrow ladders leads to the uppermost chamber which has a 360 degree view of the surrounding countryside.| Location created: Hyogo, Japan | Date created: 1601-1609 | Current location: Hyogo, near Osaka, Japan </Description>

        <Description>Description: Raku, which means "enjoyment" or "pleasure," is a famous ceramic ware associated with the tea ceremony (chanoyu). During more opulent manifestations of the ceremony, imported Chinese porcelains were prized vessels for tea. However, Sen no Rikyu rejected the smooth perfection of Chinese porcelain in favor of Chinese and Korean peasant ceramics and rustic, irregular Japanese bowls reflective of the wabi-sabi aesthetic. This tea bowl, named "Otogoze," is an example of red Raku, one of the two main types of Raku ware.    | Location created: Japan | Date created: 17th century CE | Current location: X | Medium: Red Raku ware; glazed earthenware | Measurements: X</Description>

        <Description>Description:  Although this screen bears no inscription or seal, it is considered to be the work of Tawaraya Sotatsu. This Thunder God screen is part of a pair, the other screen (not pictured) depicts the Wind God. Depictions of the gods of wind and thunder circulated in Asia a millennia before they were depicted by Sōtatsu. With their respective attributes—a bag (wind) and drums (thunder)—these figural representations of natural forces were widely available in seventeenth-century Japan. The gold foil background makes the painted figures stand out while acting as an effective decorative element in itself. The use of the gold background medium also creates a boundless space within which the demonic deities float makes these screens true masterpieces.  | Location created: Japan | Date created: 17th century CE | Current location: Kyoto National Museum, Kyoto, Japan | Medium:  Screen, ink and color on gold-foiled paper | Measurements: 169.8 x 154.5 cm</Description>

        <Description>Description: The stately, vertical forms of irises set against an angular bridge that sweeps diagonally across both screens refer to an episode in the Heian-period story, The Ise Stories (Ise monogatari). Exiled from Kyoto after an affair with a high-ranking court lady, the story’s protagonist stops at Yatsuhashi, a place where a stream branches into eight channels, each with its own bridge. The sight of irises prompts him to compose a nostalgic love poem. The first syllable of each line forms the Japanese word for irises (kakitsubata). The English translation, though unable to convey the complex wordplay of the original, is also an acrostic. Perhaps inspired by the Noh play based on this theme, Korin depicted this motif of irises in a marshland, both with and without the bridge, several times, and at least once with clear narrative elements that include human figures. Korin's signature, on the right screen, contains the honorary title 'hokkyo,' granted him by the court in 1701 and included in almost all of his major paintings. The calligraphic style of the signature and the round seals, reading 'Masatoki,' indicate that the screens must have been created during the last few years of the artist's life. | Location created: Japan | Date created: Early 18th century CE | Current location:  Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY | Medium:  Six-panel folding screens, ink, color, and gold-leaf on paper | Measurements: Each 70 1/2 x 12 ft. 2 1/4 in.

        <Description>Description:  This print depicts a stage character who is trying with all his might to uproot a stalk of bamboo. Kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjuro I was known for having developed the technique of covering his body with red powder to enhance the effect of his acting. The ukiyo-e artist Kiyomasu here displays both his own powerful techniques of depiction and the actor's animated stage skills. Kiyomasu's reputed father, Kiyonobu I, is considered to be the founder of the "theater picture" (shibai-e) and "actor portrait" (yakusha-e) genres. The type of line stylization seen in this print had its origins in the work of Kiyonobu and is sometimes called hyotan-ashi mimizu-gaki due to the fact that the muscles of the legs are exaggerated to resemble bulging gourds (hyotan), while other lines are seen to meander like earthworms (mimizu). The simplicity of the coloring (typical of so-called tan-e which typically used only one or two colors) gives added strength to this representation. | Location created: Japan | Date created: Late 17th or early 18th century CE | Current location: Tokyo National Museum | Medium:  Extra large woodblock print, color and ink on paper | Measurements: X</Description>

        <Description>Description: This image is an Edo-period ukiyo-e parody of the epic poem, The Tale of the Heike, which was written 500 years earlier. In this illustrated scene of The Tale of the Heike, Emperor Takakura happens upon servants who have swept up maple leaves to make a fire to heat sake. The emperor remarks that they seem to be aware of a poem by the Tang poet Bo Juyi alluding to just such a scene. In this parody of the episode, one of the servants plays a three-stringed shamisen, which is anachronistic, since the instrument was not used in Japan until the seventeenth century. Beside the scene the artist has added a hokku (seventeen-syllable seasonal poem), perhaps of his own composition. | Location created: Japan | Date created: c. 1750 CE | Current location: Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY | Medium: Red-colored woodblock print (benizuri-e); ink and color on paper | Measurements: 16 5/16 × 11 3/4 in.

        <Description>Description: This is one print from a series entitled, "Eight Parlour Views." This series are mitate-e parodies of the 11th century Chinese landscape painting, "Eight Views of Xioxiang." In "Eight Parlour Views," Harunobu replaces natural scenary with domestic scenes, but still includes visual clues to indicate to specify which scene it references. "Returning Sails of the Towel Rack" specifically parodies "Ship Returning from a Distant Bay." For example, towels blowing in the breeze from a towel rack on the veranda of a tea room in the print allude to the returning sailing ships.   | Location created: Japan | Date created: c. 1766 CE | Current location: Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY | Medium: Polychrome woodblock print,  ink and color on paper | Measurements: 11 3/8 x 8 17/32 in.

"Descending Geese of the Koto Bridges" specifically parodies "Wild Geese Descending on a Sandbank."The scene depicts a young girl from a wealthy family practising the koto, an instrument with movable' bridges' for each of its 13 strings. The diagonal arrangement of bridges suggests a skein of geese across the broad paulownia-wood surface like a sandbank; the pine-strewn beach design of the girl's long-sleeved kimono also reinforces the allusion.  | Location created: Japan | Date created: c. 1766 CE | Current location: Private Collection| Medium: Polychrome woodblock print,  ink and color on paper | Measurements: 11 3/8 x 8 17/32 in.

        <Description>Description: Kitagawa Utamaro is a ukiyo-e (a genre of paintings and woodblock prints developed from the Edo period to the early Meiji period) artist representing the Kansei era (1789 – 1801), the golden age of ukiyo-e, who painted a variety of beautiful women from everyday women to courtesans in Yoshiwara (the licensed quarter). The series of "Sundial of Young Women" is a set of five pictures that depict the everyday life of a town girl every ittoki (approximately two hours) from tatsu no koku (eight in the morning) to saru no koku (four in the afternoon). Since there is a morning glory in the picture drawn at "tatsu no koku" and the girl wears a summer kimono, these pictures are of her life in summer. In the Edo period, the length of ittoki changed by season and in summer, the ittoki was longer during the daytime than at night. Therefore, the tatsu no koku in summer corresponds to the current seven o'clock in the morning and saru no koku five o'clock in the evening. In this series, musen-karazuri technique, a technique to represent the outlines of a face and neck not via sumi lines, but via asperities of the woodblock surface, is used: Lips were printed in red and the face was represented as if an uncarved part emerged out of the yellow background. | Location created: Japan | Date created: 18th century CE | Current location: Tokyo National Museum | Medium: Woodblock print (nishiki-e); ink and color on paper | Measurements: 10 x 15 in</Description>

        <Description>Description: Innovative compositions, an interest in psychological states, and a fascinating interplay of social commentary, satire, and caricature characterize Japanese woodblock prints produced in the last decade of the 18th century. This print depicting A Flirt exemplifies Utamaro's interest in probing beneath the surface of a subject and his use of subtle clues to create a personality for an imaginary woman who embodies a "type." Utamaro is one of the most renowned Japanese print artists, and he is particularly revered for his skillful and searching depictions of women.  | Location created: Japan | Date created: c. 1791-1792  CE | Current location: Mr. and Mrs. John D.

        <Description>Description: In this print, Hiroshige mastered capturing the atmospheric qualities of rain and its effects on travelers wearing straw raincoats. The publisher’s name, Takenouchi, is written on the umbrella. His large red seal is stamped on the left side of the print. Hiroshige often depicted rainfall with distinct slanted lines. Here, he also added sheets of gray shading to emphasize the intensity of the downpour. In addition, three different shades of gray, requiring three different stages of the printing process, suggest distance in the thickets of bamboo in the background.The Tokaido is one of two roads between Kyoto and Tokyo. The Tokaido is roughly 319 miles long running along the eastern shore of Japan then inland between Yokkaichi and Ishiyakush. At the time of Hiroshige, the road connected the two most powerful cities in the country, as well as several smaller cities in between. Prior to 1868, the emperor and the capital of Japan rested in Kyoto, but the power resided with the shogunate in Edo. | Location created: Japan | Date created: 1833 CE | Current location: Cleveland Museum of Art | Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper | Measurements: 14 15/16 x 10 inches (38.00 x 25.40 cm)</Description>

        <Description>Description: This print is considered the masterpiece of this series and compares in its appeal with another of Hiroshige's most famous landscapes, Shono, in "The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido," which also depicts escape from a sudden rain. This print, along with the view of the Kameido plum tree (print 30 from the series), were copied in oil by Vincent van Gogh. The rolling black clouds, the torrents of rain -- depicted through an overlay of black and gray lines at different angles -- and the blue-gray of the Sumida River show the intensity of the summer storm. A solitary boatman poles his log raft downstream past the area known as Atake, impervious to the storm. This is a yūdachi—an "evening descent" of the thunder god—a summer rain in which the heavens suddenly darken late in the day, releasing torrents of rain in large drops that then quickly clear. There are six figures on the bridge, attempting to escape from the rain, under hats, mats, and umbrellas and a lone boatman on the river. Looking beyond the Shin-Ohashi, or New Great Bridge, is the Atake of the title, an informal place name for the area shown on the far bank, named after a huge bakufu ship which was moored in front of the shogunal boathouses here from the 1630s until it was dismantled in 1682. | Location created: Japan | Date created: 1857 CE | Current location: Brooklyn Museum | Medium: Woodblock print; ink and color on paper | Measurements: 14 3/16 x 9 1/8 in.
